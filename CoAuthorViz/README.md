## Instructions for Downloading the CoAuthor Dataset

A bash script has been included to help download the CoAuthor dataset. <br>
It can be run by executing the following command: <br>
`$ ./download_dataset.sh`

## Getting Started

The following instructions contain the recommended steps necessary to recreate the work. <br>
You can follow along or use any alternative methods if you prefer.

1. Install the dependencies <br>
`$ sudo apt install wget unzip git python3 python3-pip`

2. Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory <br>
`$ git clone <REPO_URL>` <br>
`$ cd <REPO_NAME>/`

3. Create a new python virtual environment <br>
`$ python3 -m venv <VENV_NAME>` <br>
`$ source <VENV_NAME>/bin/activate`

4. Install the python packages <br>
`$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Download the CoAuthor dataset <br>
`$ ./download_dataset.sh`

6. Run `scripts/main.py` and pass any `jsonl` file from the dataset as an argument <br>
`$ python3 scripts/main.py coauthor-v1.0/<FILE_NAME>.jsonl`

7. Done! The graph is generated as `<FILE_NAME>.png` and the summary statisitcs are printed in `stdout`

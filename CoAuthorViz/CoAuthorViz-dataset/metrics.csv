What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, it seems like people portray characters of Asian descent offensively far too often. Asian women are portrayed as either a submissive exotic beauty or as an overbearing femme fatale. It is rare to see someone of Asian descent playing a regular everyday person. They tend to appear as some sort of radical caricature of what a person is like and it really makes me cringe.   Anothersexample of this is the tereotypes for Asian characters athpt apear in the martial arts genre.
 I mean no disrespect to the genre in itself, but even comedy movies make fun of these characters as a spoof in an offensive way. What I would love to see is a martial arts film with an Asian actor portraying the character realistic as a normal human being. Or more romantic comedies with an Asian lead would be nice. As far as I know of, there isn't a romantic comedy with a Vietnamese woman or anyone else of Asian descent in it. 
When characters have a different ethnicity, it's offensive to always see that presented as the most prominent thing about them, especially Asian characters. It's like, This is the Asian character. People are just people and it would be nice to see it more that way in movies and books. ",15,4,6,0,5,5,5,0,3,2,0.0,0.4,0.3333333333333333,0.5647058823529412

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the term ""screen"" is unhelpful. Long before the social media age and the pandemic, people sat at home glued to TV screens for hour after hour.  

There are three main purposes of looking at a screen: for information, for social connection and for entertainment. If we divide our screen time to embrace social media and education, we are putting them to good use. And as for entertainment, this has come in large part via screens since relatively early in the twentieth century.
In my opinion, screen time icsn be a beneficial as any other leisure activity.
 The mechanics and ergonomics of screen use are another issue. Hunching over a screen is unhealthy, as is long-term squinting at a screen and its attendant physical immobility. But these are practical, not moral issues. Improved AI,  AR and robotics are likely to progressively integrate the main functions of screen time with the physical world in a relatively healthy manner. 

In time, whole populations might live mostly in virtual environments without any significant increase in health problems. The benefits of physical exercise and fresh air will still apply, but exercise has been integrated with VR and gaming since the Nintendo Wi. 

Reality and entertainment will merge in the best possible ways. Do you agree? Write me @twitter_handle.",20,6,10,0,4,6,4,2,3,1,0.0,0.5,0.2,0.6135593220338983

he system was taken over by the state and eventually was privatized to a company called Equation.

This created a society based on tiers. They were the 1%, 10% 49%, 51%, 75% and the dreaded 10%. This would now determine the fate of every dad on earth.

Then the dad's from the bottom 50% started a war with the dad's from the top 50%. It was a very quick and brutal war that was easily won by the top 50% because they had almost all the wealth and resources.

I have no medicine with me, but I try to make the patient comfortable and wait for him to get well. The next day I went to a different village to find the right medicine for the sick patient. I leave the patient behind and continue my journey. I found the medicine but it was very expensive. I was sad, thinking that the patient will not be able to afford it. So I used my own money to pay for the medicine to save the man. I returned to the village and gave the medicine to the patient. After one day the man started regaining his health. The patient was very thankful and promised to pay me back. I told him it was not necessary since I knew it would be very hard for him to pay me. I left the village and continued on with my journey. The next day I was called to another village for work. This time it was a sick woman who needed medicine. She had been sick for a whole week. I was still thinking about the patient from the previous day. ""What if she also can't afford medicine?"", I wondered. But I decided to treat the woman anyway. I treated her for a few days, and the woman started feeling better. She paid me for the medicine. As it turns out she was very wealthy and could afford the medicine.

The side effects are quite devastating, and you suddenly realize at the ripe old age of 85 how lucky you are to have escaped them entirely. However, some of the people that you love aren't quite so lucky. For example, your wife, Soeurette, is several years younger than you. She did receive the drug. She isn't aging, but the drug has its consequences. And they are manifesting now, all these years later. Will you be able to help her? 

You frankly don't trust that you will be able to help her. All your life you've done nothing but protect her from harm's way but now you don't think you will be able to.

She nods and you say you'll come back to check on her, but then when you come back, she's already gone. You are devastated that she is gone. You really can't believe that you just lost the love of your life. You take this pain and hurt you are experiencing to court and fight back hard against Biogenetic Research. Eventually, you win the lawsuit. The court decides that there is enough merit to your case to warrant a huge amount of money in damages, awarded to you.

She was a shapeshifter, and she was certain that if anyone found out, they'd be horrified. Or worse, but her in prison or a lab. 

She had been dating a guy named Jeff for a while now. And it was really going well. Almost too well. She was worried he was going to ask her to move in with him.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, although extra screen time has been needed during the pandemic, I still think we should be very worried about the excessive screen use if it continues.  think we should be worried about titbecause it has been shown to cause a variety of problems.
 One of these problems I have personal experience with and that is impaired sleep. It is now well known that staring at these screens, especially right before bedtime, can have a detrimental effect on our sleep-wake cycles.  have been using my fsmartphone to check email or a few years now and I have noticed that when I use it before bedtime, I hseem to awaken randomly in the night. Sometimes it may even take me up to an hour to fall asleep again. This is not good for my sleep-wake cycle and I am sure it is not good for my health. I hate to imagine how this affects the developing brains of children as young as 6. 
Another reason we still need to be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of physical activity. Especially if people are playing games and doing other things with their devices for long periods of time throughout the day, that is less time that someone may be standing up to do anything at all. It's hard to make time for exercise with you face always in a screen.  
he last reason I think we should be worried about excessive screen use is because of the lack of social interaction.
 This, of course, would not apply to those who use the screen to connect with others through zoom. But, if you're only doing activities on your screen in isolation, this could have bad effects on our ability to socialize over time. 
The pandemic has caused the need for more screen use, yes. However, I feel that we need to take caution and show concern about our excessive screen use. There are just too many associated risks not to. ",22,6,11,0,5,5,5,0,3,2,0.0,0.5,0.22727272727272727,0.5169902912621359

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, having a period is definitely a naturally occurring bodily function that is not shameful. It should definitely not be shameful to talk about as many women are experiencing it and it is a normal part of life. So yes, I am very much in favor of schools providing free pads and tampons to students. It is of the student's discretion on how she wants to handle it. It can be as discrete or as open as she wants it to be, and I think it's time that we rethink how this naturally occurring bodily function has been quite a taboo in our society.

Firstly, how our government should allocate budget with getting rid of period poverty. Instead of allocating more funds in our military or in the police force, our government should allocate more funds in providing free pads and tampons to students. Senators are granted budgets for their Viagra pills and other medications, but why are our schools do not get budgets for free pads and tampons? This is daylight robbery, and our students in this country has had enough.

Second, proper history, education, and awareness of periods should be taught in schools. Even if a student is free to be discrete or open about their period, one thing's for sure: they should not be ashamed of it. If a student had a period accident, it shouldn't be a big deal. Students should be able to talk about it freely without being shamed and probably the most important of all, is how teachers should have the capability and the authority to help a student that needs help with her period.

And lastly, freedom of choice should be given to our students. It doesn't matter whether a student wants to use a tampon or a pad, they should be given the freedom to choose what they want to use. There shouldn't be any stigma about tampons being ""unladylike"" or ""gross"". Nor the menstrual pads being ""unhygienic"" or ""unsanitary"". It's a matter of personal preference, and shame on anyone who thinks otherwise.

So in the end, my point is simple. Periods are natural, and it should not be a taboo. Government, schools, educators and students alike should all rally to help end period poverty. That way the women of the future are freer to expand their minds and their horizons, without the burden of period poverty holding them back.",29,7,3,1,18,30,21,9,0,21,0.034482758620689655,0.10344827586206896,0.6551724137931034,0.4570230607966457

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we aren't bad citizens at all if we don't keep up with the news. I personally hate watching the news simply because it is such a negative piece of media. Most of the stories are negative, and if I can avoid them I won't be upset by those stories.

Anything that is super important we can't avoid news wise. For example the coronavirus was impossible to avoid. I'd see it pop up constantly on television and on social media. 

I don't think engaging in current events really does anything for us unless we are passionate about the event. Most people see a current event pop up on the news and never really think about it again unless it is personally having an affect on them. 

It is not our responsibility to keep up with what is going on in the world. It is our responsibility to prioritize our life and our families life. That's my number one priority and that is never going to change.

If I am watching the news and see a murder story, a robbery, anything like that is not going to have a positive affect on my life. Knowing that information also isn't going to change my life in any way. So what is the point of me hearing that story?

I think way too many people are obsessed with the idea of news more than the news itself. They're afraid of missing out on the hot topic that everyone is talking about. I personally don't care about any of that. I don't like to gossip anyway. I think that it's most important that we do what we love and surround ourselves with the ones we love.

Like I said, if the news is really that urgent, we'll find out about it one way or the other. I haven't been a news person since the day I was born and it hasn't had a negative affect on me at all. I plan to stay that way until not knowing something that was said or written on the news personally affects me in a negative way.

The news will always be evil to me. I will never pay it any attention because in my opinion, the news is always negative and preys off of fear and anxiety.

Suddenly, the ground started to shake and a huge wall of stone rose from the ground. The Tyrant was trapped in the stone, and I was safe. 

My friend, named Harry, was a fire manipulator. He told me that I was a 'Stone Shaper'. We fought together against the Tyrants.  I developed feelings for Harry, and during a particular night patrol we kissed. 

I still couldn't believe he's gone. I was in the middle of a battle yesterday with a Tyrant when Harry came to my rescue. His heart was pierced by a Tyrant's blade. I crushed that tyrant with a boulder, and I screamed in agony when I saw Harry's body.

But I will move on and continue to avenge Harry. We will not live in fear of the Tyrants.",31,3,12,1,15,20,17,3,1,16,0.03225806451612903,0.3870967741935484,0.5161290322580645,0.5513784461152882

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks can be a comparable if not more pleasant experience for many types of readers. The benefits of listening to an audiobook, is that the reader can engage with a story at a good pace. Some people are not as fast as readers as others, and notably may struggle to read depending on the contents of the story. Others simply do not like holding a book, and would rather listen as they go through their daily tasks. Listening is seen as a passive ability, as many are skilled at doing so while they engage in other activities such as driving, or even while exercising. Listening also has the benefit of engaging a person into the setting of the story, as a good audiobook narrator is skilled at voicing the characters and also at setting the background and surroundings facing the characters.

Reading, while more active and requiring more concentration than listening, can be a more involved and personal activity than listening. Readers can control their pace, and even take notes on areas in the book that they may wish to look into more or take further time to understand. They can go back on what they read to see the characters under new contexts and information. A reader, can also dictate how a character sounds, as listening to an audiobook sets that choice for the listener, who may or may not agree with the narrator's choice. 

In my opinion, I prefer reading over listening to an audiobook. While good audiobook narrators can add to the experience of a book, they are not able to be the definite choice for the author's characters, much less how I can picture the characters in their tone, dialect, and even inflection. For me to get immersed, I have to chose my own pace for engaging in the story, taking the time to pause the story if I want to think more in depth about what has happened, or to connect it with other thoughts I may have. An audiobook while it can be paused, will always move a constant pace dictated by the narrator. Sometimes, I may show excitement or a strong interest to continue reading into the plot, reading faster to see what happens next to the characters. Other times, I slow down to absorb all the information of the book's pages, to better understand what happens next in the book. Ultimately I enjoy being able to address the story in ways that an audiobook cannot offer based on the strengths and weaknesses of both mediums.",23,7,12,0,4,4,4,0,3,1,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.17391304347826086,0.453027139874739
14,440fa5b3461a45579c96533ffe0e1396.jsonl,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't be overly worried about screen time. Yes, it's not good to be attached to a screen 24/7 but most people aren't glued to a screen every single second of the day because they have other things to do. 
The important thing is to be aware of how much screen time you're getting and to make sure you're not spending too much time on your
 screen at one time. I'd say as long as everyone takes a break to ease the strain from looking at a screen at least once every day, then we'll be fine. 

I think it's time we get comfortable and embrace technology because it's not going to go anywhere and technology really makes our lives so much easier in many ways. We can look up information we need quickly, it's convenient to look up something on your phone while you are out shopping. 

Technology is helpful in so many ways there's really no reason why we should be worried about spending too much time on screens besides for our eyes getting strained.

To conclude: Excessive screen time can definitely strain your eyes and cause stress, but I think we'll be fine as long as we take periodic breaks each day and don't spend too much time on our screens. If we take periodic breaks we will be fine.

Unfortunately, the movie is rather boring, and the other people around you seem to notice as well.  A couple of them are even texting each other on their smartphones.
You are bored out of your mind, and you can't wait for the movie to be over.
  

You decide to make conversation with the person sitting next to you.  He looks just like you, but is more fashionably dressed.

No, he never did""  your dapper counterpart replies, ""and it would have been so easy for him""


""Well, I lived in a small town"" you retort, ""it's not always easy to get away when there are no opportunities"".
""Yeah, but this guy was a total loser.
  And besides, we all have the same opportunity.  Didn't you get the message from us in childhood about following the white rabbit?  This guy in the movie saw that rabbit in the park, on the sidewalk, in his front yard, and he never followed it.  He just shook his head and went back to his desk.""

""Yeah, we all got something like that in our lives.  Luckily, most of us figured out what it meant, and that's why we're here in the theater voluntarily.""

You struggle to think of what to say, but as you try to speak, the movie ends with the character falling over at his desk.  

""Well that was almost as bad as the movie that played right before you arrived"" the well-dressed man snorts.  ""Ah well, when you live in heaven, sometimes it can be fun to visit the other side.""  He then mutters some obscure code and disappears.

You try to get up, but realize that your muscles won't allow it.  

Another movie starts playing.  It's another version of you on screen, at a desk just like yours.  You think you see a rabbit on his lawn, outside of his window, but he doesn't see it.

She seems to date a wide variety of men, being open-minded for any chance of of finding her soul mate. She is unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.

It started just like any other date for the woman, she seemed to have hit it well with the man, who appeared suddenly as she was getting her daily coffee. He seemed to share her favorite interests, he liked the same type of coffee, and he was into the same kind of music she liked to hear. Granted, many of her ex's were the same, sharing many of her favorite interests and hobbies. To her, however, Mike seemed to be a bit different than her past dates. He seemed a bit mellow and reserved, being passive and waiting for her to speak and make the first move. A welcome change than her past dates, who seemed to be more active and confident. On the date, Mike still appeared meek and nervous.

""Relax, I'm not going to bite you,"" Clara mentioned to Mike, who looked down on the menu to avert his eyes from hers. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable,"" Mike spoke, in a tone just above a whisper.

Sure enough, the dinner went fairly well, and she was content to be with Mike. They decided to watch a movie together, at his house later that day.

In the midst of the movie, Mike excused himself, mentioning his urgency to go to the restroom. Come to think of, Clara thought, Mike goes to the bathroom quite often. He had done so very often during dinner, and seemed to still want to go during the movie. Curious, Clara paused the movie and tip toed to the bathroom.

The door was unlocked, and she peered inside. Clara was shocked, to see Mike transforming back into his true form. An amorphous blob with no discernible shape, something she had not seen before in her life. Surprised, she inadvertently let out a gasp and ran back to the couch. Mike, heard the commotion, and realized Clara had seen his true form. He quickly changed back into Mike, and went back to see Clara.
""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you,"" Mike said, as he sat back down next to her.


Clara was speechless, she did not know who or what was truly staring back at her with seemingly human eyes.

""The truth is, I am a shapeshifter, and this is the 6th time I've been on a date with you"", Mike said with hesitance in his voice.

Clara was surprised, all of her ex's were the same person, a shapeshifter that was seemingly infatuated with her. 

""I know it's hard to believe, but I really do like you, and I want to be with you,"" Mike said, as he reached for her hand.

She grabbed it, and pondered, perhaps she was being a bit hard on him. She wondered how hard it might be for him to form a long-time relationship, and if others like him were successful in doing so. Smiling at him and motioning at the TV, Clara and Mike resumed the movie, continuing their date. They continued to date long into the future, now closer to each other given that Clara is aware of Mike's true identity. Mike himself, decided to stop lying to Clara about who he is and regarding his personality, and found that she liked him quite more than the first time they went on a date.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

That is what he enjoyed. Surprisingly the other pigs he ate wasn't his 99 brothers and sisters. They managed to get back to the farm. His brothers and sisters wondered what happened to 92 and if he was okay.

The other pigs where relaxing and enjoying each others company. When out of nowhere 92 jumped out of the bushes to attack. He attacked one of his sisters and bit her on the leg.

The other pigs fought off 92 and pinned him to the ground. They then took him to the barn and tied him up. Surprisingly no one else was hurt. His sister was fine as well as she was taken care of.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology is a positive effect in dating. I think the addition of dating apps have made it possible for so many more people to find true love who otherwise would not have been able to. What datings app do for someone who uses them the right way is open up the pool of potential partners to a much higher number than if they were to go out physically searching for a partner. When someone is single, sometimes they can get to the point where they want a partner so bad that they lower their expectations. Dating apps group a bunch of people together who want similar relationships, and this makes it much easier! Just think of the single mothers and fathers with no time to go out and meet someone, without dating apps they may not have the chance to find a genuine relationship the way they were able to before starting a family. Plus, notonly do dating apps make it easier to meet someone, Ihey have made it easier to maintain relationships.
 You know from the jump what the other person is looking for, and this allows you to invest more into the relationship from the jump. You are able to be open about your feelings and open about your expectations because you know the other person is also looking for something similar. 

I personally have done dating with and without dating apps. I have had three girlfriends just going through high school and college, as it was much easier to meet people this way. When i graduated college, i was not interested in going to bars or parties, so i chose to use a dating app instead of simply waiting for the right person to find me. Although i met some people who i did not think i would be with for a long time, it really increased my perspective in what i wanted in a relationship. Later on, i met my fiance on a dating app whom I hit it off with right away. There is still a degree of luck to a dating app i would say, but probably less than simply being in the right place at the right time to meet people in person. Dating apps to me are just more of a way to get dates, to find your person. I still much rather talk on the app for only a couple of days and then meet in person for an official date. So to me personally, it is not super different. 

Now as far as other apps and their effect on relationships, this is either positive or negative depending on how the person themselves use the apps. Technology and apps are simply something that are going to be around, and with any positive comes a negative as you can use and abuse the positive. If the technology is taking away from your personal time with your significant other than it is time to dial it back. If you find yourself on social media when your partner wants you attention, this is a red flag. However, if you are using an app like netflix productively, and enjoying a show with your signficant other and cuddling, this can be a positive. It is all about balance. Anything that is good also needs to be used in balance. So in conclsuion, i personally feel that technology nowadays is a good thing for dating and relationships. I think it has made things easier for so many people. It is the person's decision to decide how they are going to use the app, so in the end whether it is positive or negative is up to every individual themselves.",36,9,26,0,1,3,1,2,1,0,0.0,0.7222222222222222,0.027777777777777776,0.38529411764705884

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford pads and tampons. Periods are a natural part of life, and girls should not have to worry about how they are going to afford them. Did you know that girls can go through up to 14 pads or tampons a day? I mean, that’s a lot of money! That's especially the case considering that the average woman spends a huge amount of money on tampons and pads over her lifetime. Let's break down those numbers for a minute. 
The average woman menstruates for about 30 years.
 Now, a box of tampons costs $7 and a box of pads costs $5. But wait, now we need to figure out how many boxes a woman goes through in a year. If a woman goes through 14 boxes of pads and tampons in a year, that’s $2,940. And then we need to multiply that by 30 years. That’s $73,000! 

I cannot fathom how much money I would have saved if I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to afford tampons and pads. Think about what you could do with that money. Now, a man might say, “Well, why don’t you just use toilet paper?” But that’s not the same. In fact, toilet paper is not absorbent enough to be used as a pad. If a girl tried to use toilet paper as a pad, it would just fall apart. It would immediately soak through and leave a girl’s underwear and pants completely soaked. And if a girl tried to use toilet paper as a tampon, it would just fall out. And that would be a huge mess, and would cause a lot of pain and embarrassment. 

So no, toilet paper is not an adequate substitute for pads and tampons. And a man should not speak when he has no idea what it’s like to menstruate. I personally believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons to students because they should try to put girls and boys on equal ground. How would a man feel if he suddenly needed to spend $73,000 over his lifetime on products that he needs to use to function? I mean, don't experts always say that women lag far behind men in terms of pay? And moreover, don't experts always say that women's savings accounts are far less than men's? Schools shouldn't be trying to put girls behind even more and exacerbate inequalities. That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students. It's really a small price to pay for a girl's dignity and for a girl's future financial freedom and security. For these reasons, I humbly request school districts across the country to consider the arguments made herein and provide free pads and tampons to their students.",39,7,5,1,26,46,31,15,2,29,0.02564102564102564,0.1282051282051282,0.6923076923076923,0.4192495921696574

I thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.The bee then said ""Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.""
 I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could.  got asomestick sand leafvesand I made a lhive that looked just like a little house for the bees. ""How's that?"" I asked the bee when I was finished.I heard the bee say ""It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.""
 
""And what's that?"" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. There, it's safe now.,
 I said to the bee.
The next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. ""They won't sting me will they?"" I asked my new friend. ""No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,"" the bee replied.
 And then I had a great idea. 
""Little bee I have a favor to ask of you,"" I told my friend. 
""What is that?"" asked the friendly bee.
""I am so allergic to a bee sting. I am willing to be your queen and I will even stay and guard the hive if you do me this one thing. Can you make me not allergic to bee stings?""
""I don't think I have the power,"" said the bee. ""But I can travel far and wide and tell all of the bees that you are my queen and that they can never sting you.""
""That would be great!"", I exclaimed.  So a great deal was worked out. I kept the bees safe from harm and I was protected from being stung by bees again for the rest of my life. The end.",34,4,22,0,8,9,8,1,3,5,0.0,0.6470588235294118,0.23529411764705882,0.41739130434782606

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, it is not quite as good as reading an actual book. I think that hearing your own voice in your head as you read words pulls you in more. You also have to focus more on the book if you are physically reading it. When you are listening to an audiobook, you can do other things while you listen. That's both good and bad. It's good for someone who doesn't like to read but wants to expand their world a little. It's also good for someone who is very busy and only has time to listen to an audiobook while they are cleaning the house or driving to and from work. 
I think that listening to an audiobook is a great way to get into the habit of reading.
 It can expose you to genres that you may not have known you liked before. It can also help you to figure out who your favorite author is. You can then choose to go and get physical copies of their books to read. I think that listening to audiobooks is a great way to get into the habit of reading.

There are also people who do not have good eyesight or get headaches while reading that benefit from an audiobook. So for those people it's possibly the only choice that would work for them. 

The selection of audiobooks is great. They are often more readily available to download from Amazon or even the library than some of the physical copies, especially if a book is more rare. It's a great alternative in these cases. 
I think that there are some disadvantages to listening to an audiobook.
 It can make it so you never get into the habit of reading physical book. That's a shame because it's such a great journey to take. You can also miss out on some of the great things that come from reading a physical book. The act of holding it and using a bookmark. It brings back nostalgic memories from a simpler time. 

In general I do not think an audio book is as good as a physical book. I feel if you have the option of both that the audiobook is robbing you of some of the experience. Audiobooks are great for some people but they shouldn't be your first choice when it comes to reading(or listening) to novels.",32,7,20,0,5,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.625,0.15625,0.4008810572687225

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. They should learn how to read, write, and do math. These are the basics that will help them succeed in life. 

I think the most important thing I have learned in school is how to read.  There is knowledge about every topic under the sun, if only one can read about it. Reading, and truly understanding any topic is essential to improving and learning, no matter which profession we choose in life.  Being able to read exposes us to new ideas, stimulates our minds, and keeps us curious. 

Reading is important because it helps us to learn and understand things. It will help us in the future because we will be able to read and understand things that we need to know, whatever we are doing. 

Similarly, writing allows us to share our idea with others. Writing is the counterpart to reading-we record our knowledge, to help others improve, sharing ourselves for them to experience. Writing is essential to reading, and vice-versa. 

Math is important because it is the language of science. It is the language of the universe. It is exact, unchangeable, and present in everything. Math is the reading and writing of the world we live in. It is the constant scientific expression of our carbon-based lifeforms. ath is important because it allows us to understand the world around us.
 It is the precise reading of what the universe has written. 

Math, reading, and writing are all intrinsically linked, each having an effect on each other, each able to better interpret the others. 
Because of the this, they are the three basic building blocks, from which everything else can be constructed, the most important subjects anyone can study.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology such as social media and dating apps have had a positive affect on dating and relationships. Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting.

That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person.

I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds.

I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves.

Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. 

I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones. So there is obviously value in them and hopefully they're here to stay. ",34,9,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.7352941176470589,0.0,0.43775100401606426
29,780c48b1977548dfa5e66adf6b2f9d51.jsonl,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. 

Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with the person they are sitting in front of.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

I’m sure the next pandemic we face will be in some way digitally transmitted. Maybe it already has begun.

In my opinion, it is only fair to pay the students who are earning so much money for their respective colleges, after all, they are the ones playing and performing in front of large crowds and broadcasting live on TV.  There is no other situation in America where people are expected to work so hard, practicing and competing, for so little return.  Yes, they do get a scholarship to attend college, but in terms of their worth to the colleges, this is minimal.  If the colleges don't want to have their players as professionals they should not have set up the sports to resemble professional competitions.   They have made the rules and policies that could lead to making their athletes into professionals.  The players are expected to act as professionals, train as professions, and put their health on the line, especially in football, like professionals, it is only fair to compensate them as professionals.  In addition, the coaches make ample money, the product is canned enough the schools make plenty of money, the broadcasters make large sums of money from advertising revenues.   To me, it is akin to slave labor to expect so much from someone, in terms of effort, and not to compensate them.

Meanwhile, the alien captor tries to interrogate Matt Damon. He tries to get him to reveal some juicy Hollywood gossip or something. As it turns out, this alien is a huge fan of the Jason Bourne movies in particular, and Hollywood  in general,  and he's eager to find out what Matt Damon or any of his actor friends have been up to lately. The interrogation doesn't go well. Matt Damon remains steadfastly silent. The alien is left with no choice but to put him back in his cell.

Back on Earth, the Space Force is ready. They launch the rescue mission, and intercept the alien ship quickly. It's automated defenses are no match for the advanced weaponry of Earth's Space Force. In a matter of moments, the ship's hull has been breached and the craft has been boarded. The troops move in for the rescue. The alien scrambles, and moves Matt Damon to the most secure area of the ship, but the impregnated doors soon fall to Space Force beam weaponry.

The Space Force enters the area, and finds the alien holding Matt Damon at gunpoint. They aim their own weapons, and try to explain to the alien that Matt Damon is the real-life person whose life we pretend to live, and that if he isn't freed, humanity will vanish like a forgotten dream. But, the alien is easily panicked, and doesn't understand what they're saying, and mistakenly shoots Matt Damon, killing him instantly.

The alien screws his eyes shut, and waits for the Space Force to kill him in reprisal, but nothing happens. He opens his eyes, and sees that the Space Force has disappeared, along with the rest of humanity, disappeared like vapor without the life essence of Matt Damon to sustain them.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screen time and its negative effects are being primarily overstated. While there are legitimate complaints to be made of excessive screen use, such as it being a deterrent to healthy sleep schedules if used too late at night, many people can control and moderate their screen use in a practical and healthy matter. Digital devices and other types of screen use varies in its usage. Some use it for social media, while others use it for work or personal recreation. The more traditional forms of displaying content or information, such as books and paper documents are being phased out, instead being replaced by digital media and content. For the most part, this is a good outcome. Digital documents and media saves paper and physical resources, and can easily be accessed by many. any have never been able to afford books, and with the Amazon Kindle even those that can afford books are choosing alternatives.. Beyond digital books, people can engage with literature through audio books, or even video formats. There are a multitude of different forms of screen use today, many of which have been adopted by countless in the world due to the pandemic, that is beneficial and worthwhile to engage in. The benefits offered by such screen use outweigh the negative consequences and setbacks, but those consequences should still be kept in mind by its users.
Intuitively, the benefits of screen time and digital devices vastly exceed their negatives., but those negatives in turn still exist and pose problems to individuals. I believe those problems can be addressed, and reduced, to lessen the harm incurred to people. For example, excessive screen use may negatively affect the mood of a person, who engages too often online with content that worries them, or worsens their mood. For those individuals, it would be practical to take frequent breaks from screen use, and or to engage with others in person. Likewise, many will still benefit from in person interactions, as screen use may not offer the same types of social benefits that people experience when they meet up with people close to them. Going out with friends, or seeing people you know in public is good for the psyche, and doing so can be a benefit concurrent with screen use. People can connect with others and form relationships online, choosing to further said relationships in person and outside of online forums. Thus, it is necessary the many in society embrace the integration of screen use and digital media in society. For the benefits screen use incurs to its users will benefit many in their lives, and to deny it is to decrease the benefits available to people around the world. It is only after such digital media and screen use are both accepted and understood that people can find a middle ground in their usage to maximize its benefits, and minimize its drawbacks.",26,6,16,0,4,5,4,1,4,0,0.0,0.6153846153846154,0.15384615384615385,0.4679715302491103

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships better. In the past, in order to meet the ""right person"" you have to be almost preternaturally lucky. A chance invitation, lucky coincidence, and happenstance ruled the day. For every million compatible partners, you'd be lucky to meet one. Now, with the advent of dating apps and social media, you can find compatible people in your area with a few clicks.

And there's no rule you can't go out of your area. I have met people who have travelled thousands of miles to meet someone they thought might be the right one.
Technology has aade it easier to communicate.
 But this ease of communication comes with a cost.
It's easy to send a message, but it's hard to know if the other person is interested.
 It's easier to lie. It is easier to be too casual about relationships. In the feed of potential partner after potential partner, faces can become a blur. Partners can be more interchangeable. The phrase ""there are more fish in the sea"" has never been more true.
Technology has also made it easier to cheat.
 There is precious little independent verification, in most dating apps, of the personal details and photos posted by members. Is the photo accurate? Was it taken in the last year? Is it even a photo of the person who posted it? Are the personal details even remotely accurate? In real life, maybe 15% of the people you meet are fit and trim. On the apps, its 90% if not more! echnology has also made it easier to be a ""player"""". And that is not a good thing.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 
The world is now a place where the supernatural is commonplace, and where the power of Mana can be used to create magic items, summon spirits
 and uncertainty and struggle abounds the remaining humans on the planet who have to gather and harness the mana in order to destroy their hostile alien foes. It's the only chance humanity has and fortunately it's a very good chance, especially since there is a human group called, ""Nathosilum"" who have gathered quite a bit of mana of their own as well as nurtured their magical powers to the extent of being able to kill even the most powerful aliens. 

The only problem that they have is they need to train quite a bit more fellow humans in order to overpower the aliens. And the only way to do that is to find the remaining humans who are scattered all over the world and train them. As Nathosilum goes to every continent and spreading their encoded message to all humans across the globe, more and more have risen up to the challenge. All that's left is to create plan and execute it. 

The plan is to create a magical barrier that will prevent the aliens from entering the planet and to do that they need to gather a lot humans who have the power to create shields, but before they can execute that plan, they have to kill the remaining aliens on planet Earth first which is handled by the most powerful warriors of Nathosilum. Their warriors are employed of various powers such as controlling certain elements such as water, fire, earth and air, but the most powerful of them is a warrior named, Sithilius who controls dark matter. This power of controlling dark matter is the single most power element that can be used against the aliens since these aliens are from an alternate universe that is made up of 0.00001% more dark matter than everything within our universe. That small microscopic difference is all the difference and the aliens don't know that Sithilius has that power.

Nathosilum has gathered everyone that they need and Sithilius has begun to eliminate all aliens on the planet. He's so powerful that he can concentrate his energy and manipulate all dark matter on the planet and recognize whether they're aliens are not since he can sense that tiny bit difference of dark matter that aliens have. It takes him much of his energy and concentration but within 16 hours he manages to wipe all of aliens on the planet.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, good citizens should be expected to keep reasonably informed about the news, both national and international. The ancient Greeks, who we model much of our own civilization from, judged a man a fool who did not understand the affairs of the day. I think that is a good standard to hold ourselves to. Some might feel that they should just be left alone to mange their own business, without needing to know what is going on in the world around them.  However, nobody in modern society is an island. A well-informed population is especially important in democratic systems. If people are not informed, they cannot make informed decisions about who to vote for, or what laws to support. The morality and justness of a democracy hinges on the population making reasonable and informed decisions. In this light we can see that it is selfish and dangerous to allow ourselves to be ignorant of the news. Society only works when people are responsible not only for themselves but for each other and for the community as a whole. We can only act to help our community when we are educated about the issues it faces. For these reasons we must all take the responsibility to learn the news and to understand it. In this way we can move together wisely into a better world. ",19,6,11,0,2,7,2,5,0,2,0.0,0.5789473684210527,0.10526315789473684,0.564625850340136

The first line was just as if a name was being written but it would stop a quarter of the way, erase, and than write another name. This told me that the rankings were not in at this point yet. This was probably the first step to realizing that this wasn't a ranking at all. This was just a decorative mug, maybe with some sort of sentimental meaning, or a project that hasnt been finished.

In my opinion, the most important thing to teach students is a love of learning and to be curious, and to ask questions.

  What we want from people, to be good citizens, you need to be a life long learner, and you need to be curious.  The more information people absorb, the more they analyze what is going on around then, and the more people study how things have happened before, the more they can contribute to society.  Even as I approach middle age I feel like I am still learning every day, I have learned that you can never stop learning, and that the more you learn the more you realize how much there is to learn.  If this were the foundation stone of school, the first building block , the rest of the curriculum would fall into place.  I know teachers struggle with students who are not interested, and I know this can have a detrimental impact on a class and other students, but if you can get a student interested in something they will want to learn more.

She frantically looked around to see if she had been imagining things, but he was nowhere to be found. She was convinced that she had seen him there, and wasn’t just going crazy. She decided to call her friends for help.

Upon hearing the woman's story, her friends rushed right over. They reminded her of things that had happened with previous boyfriends: some of them shared the same mannerisms, but the woman chalked that up to growing up in the same region. Two of them had almost identical haircuts, and three more had the same unique hobby of collecting straws.

Feeling satisfied that she wasn't losing her mind, the woman talked with her friends about whether the shapeshifter was actually all of her previous boyfriends. If so, why was he so interested in her? Was he dangerous? What did he want from her? In a way, it was flattering that a being would try over and over to win her love. He was always respectful of her and only treated her with love. It was her fear of commitment that ended the previous relationships.

She thought for a while about whether she was ready for a serious relationship. She decided to send the shapeshifter a message so they could talk things over. In her message, she told him she knew that he was a shapeshifter and wanted to talk about it.

This is a story of the end of the world, and the beginning of the next.
 John was the second generation to start to have noticeable powers. It was almost something that he had taken for granted, as he did not know what it was like before to have none. There were now classes in the little school to teach the children how to harness their Mana and use it, in the hopes that one day a generation would be strong enough to take back their home.
John was now in his final year of school, and was one of the stronger students.
 While he was stronger, he was still not considered unusual, as there had been far more impressive people he had learned about in his history class. He didn't know that one day that was about to change and he could hold the key to restoring order on his earth.
He was a tall, well-built young man with short brown hair and a friendly face.
 Nothing that spoke to the powers that were laying in wait inside him. It was during a practice exercise that he began to feel different. The goal was to either provide a shield around yourself, or blast away a fake alien that was in the fight room. A good student could be fairly impressive at one, although no one was really that great. The instructors hoped that with practice though, the children would be powerful enough when they grew up to serve the security force well.

Suddenly it was John's turn. He felt a cold stillness take over his body that he had never felt before. And then suddenly it exploded around him. The fake alien flew back against the wall with such force that it clattered to the ground in pieces. But not only that, there was now a distinctive blue shield around John. He had done both.
The instructors were stunned.
 No one could speak. Finally they told John to release his shield and shower and get ready for his next class. By the time he went home and had dinner for his family, he had forgotten about his display, but the school had not. There was a knock at the door and the headmaster and the head of security were ushered into the sitting room. They conferred with John's parents for quite some time.
""John, we have some good news for you,"" his father said.
 "" You are going to be given an opportunity that most can only dream of."" 
""You are going to the capital"" There were tears in his father's eyes but pride in his voice. And John knew that while it was called an opportunity, he was not being given a choice.

In my opinion, Colleges should participate in giving back to student athletes. Students who play on their college teams should reap, at least some, of the rewards made off of them. Young people who participate in fairly dangerous sports, often are injured DURING their college years, meaning they are basically ""thrown"" away. They get nothing for their sacrifice. They made a ton of money for the school, but can't enjoy any benefit, except for the brief time they were playing, getting recognition. 

I have some tangential connection to this. I was able to get a college education due to my Tuba Playing abilities, getting a band scholarship.  This was made sort of possible because of the football teams at my college, and the semi fame of the music program there.  I saw many of the athletes, whom I went to class with, overtired, barely making it. One of my classmates is now sort of Famous. He's Scottie Pippin. I'm telling the complete truth here. He as a tall talented person during College but none of us had any real idea about how famous he'd eventually become.  His family and he struggled these years. It would have been so much better if he could have got a nice endorsement while playing at UCA, my Alma Mater. Even if it would have been fairly modest, it would have meant the world to his family.  They could have enjoyed, at least, knowing they had a roof over their heads, and someplace safe to rest.

This is forbidden, even though athletes give their educational, physical, and emotional selves so fully. It seems so unfair. Why can't some benefit be offered? It doesn't have to be extreme. It would be fine if there was a CAP on this, but still. Why NOTHING? Also, what about the rest of the team? What about the Pep band, Marching bands, etc, that support them, I think they could give even MORE scholarships to poor young people who participate in these programs. let's spread the money around some. Many of these students work, at least part time to help pay money towards their education.  They sleep little and work almost always. I was the same. At one point I was working 2 jobs, playing in the marching band, and Concert touring band, and serving as president of Kappa Kappa Psi, the band service fraternity, who raised a lot of money for the band.  (which supported the athletic system there). 

Scottie and myself would have benefited directly from a loosening of the purse strings. Spread the money around more. Help more people helps us all. If I could have afforded to focus more on my actual education, instead of having to work, my life could have turned out differently. Scotties family, also could have benefitted, helping everyone in the process.",44,9,32,0,3,3,3,0,1,2,0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.06818181818181818,0.5360501567398119

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.   And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

You simply swipe in one direction if you're interested in the person in the picture and swipe the other way if you're not. 

Technology can also allow couples to bond using an app like Netflix. Think of how many shows on Netflix have been appointment viewing for couples. Stranger Things and Outer Banks come to mind right away. Technology also allows us to take photos and videos of our experiences with our significant other which can create memories that last forever. Without those pictures and videos all we really can rely on is our memory.

In general, I believe that technology has had a very positive effect on dating and relationships.

The effects last a lifetime, and only one dose of the drug is needed for a person to stop aging. People all around the world are given the drug. However, the drug is monitored and only administered to people that are below the age of 20. It was determined that the effects of the drug are not suitable for those older than 20, and that they would still continue to age. Thus, many in the world still found themselves at the mercy of aging, with countless feeling jealous of those that took the drug and would keep their youth forever.
The world hasdchanged for the better, with many now living enjoyable and carefree lives.
 It was a peaceful era, that would appear to last forever, just like the users that stopped aging. owever, 50 years later, people in the world began to feel strange.
 The symptoms seemed mild at first for the user.s. They would experience mild nausea, and blurriness, with some feeling dizzy at times. Scientists and doctors concluded it was nothing too serious to worry about, and reassured people that they would be fine. Despite their reassurances, the symptoms soon began intensifying and growing in severity. For some, they experienced intense fevers, others lost sensation in different parts of the body, being paralyzed for hours on end. Many were scared of the symptoms, begging for a cure if it existed, and a treatment to ease their pain.

Ultimately scientists and experts around the world could not determine how the side effects manifested. The drug was taken off the market and further research would be made to determine if a cure existed. Their efforts and research had not yet gone underway when the first deaths began being recorded among the users. The deaths were in-explainable, with some users seemingly dying in their sleep. They would suddenly stop breathing, and their heart would just stop beating. Like the symptoms before, doctors were baffled on what could have caused such deaths, and were unable to stop further fatalities from concurring among the drug users. While the drug had granted them eternal youth, it seems that it had taken the ultimate price, for those that stopped aging would die just like any other person. It seemed that the drug would eventually kill the user at an undetermined time, but it was almost a guarantee on how they would die. Some simply died in their sleep, others died while walking down the street, and some even went to work one day, only to die during their shift. 

Uncertainty faced the drug users who feared that they would die at any given time, and the possibility of death could be closer than they think. For those that were not administered the drug, they stopped feeling envious of the youth of the drug users. They accepted their aging, feeling sympathy for those who feared their inevitable death which could happen at anytime or place.

Students that are athletes at a college level work very diligently and put a lot of effort in their physical prowess and skill. They are also required to maintain a certain grade point average in order to remain eligible for their sport. To handle both is daunting and time consuming, along with other potential demands and obligations student athletes may hold. It is only fair to compensate athletes for the work they put into the sports they participate in, given that without said compensation , they would not be able to afford the cost of attending college along with other costs associated with being an athlete. Colleges demands lots of time, money, and effort from their student athletes, which they may struggle to pay if they are unable to hold a job, either part-time and full-time. Just as athletes in major organizations are paid for their efforts and even for their name/likeness, so to should college-level athletes.

The main issue that is mentioned by many regarding paying student athletes is that it is a potential cost by colleges that may compromise its finances, which it may invest in other areas of said institution. However, this is a weak argument, as the money that would be spent on paying student athletes would be minimal in comparison to the revenue that can be generated from their participation and performance. This is true of major athletes, the top athletes who are revered by many and whose loyal fans are willing to pay for their jerseys, tickets, and other memorabilia. Even the argument regarding the bidding wars that arise from student athletes that are sought by many universities is not a strong one to hold, as it is not a bidding war that is forced upon the universities, but rather a choice that they make to pursue said athlete. The prevalence of bidding wars can be reduced if not eliminated if regulations are set in place, and said rules are enforced regarding how much athletes are paid. Ideally, athletes should be paid a salary that is comparable to the average salary of a full-time employee, which would be around $50,000. That way, at minimum they can afford tuition, housing, and other expenses without going into debt. All applicable athletes should be paid fair and equal salaries, that way no disparities exist based on performance and prestige. If such disparities exist, than so too can bidding wars exist for the most desired athletes, who would be paid excessively in comparison to less prestigious athletes. Regardless, athletes should still be paid a fair wage for their efforts, and for them to not only continue playing the sport they invest time in, but also further their educational career.",24,9,8,0,7,9,7,2,1,6,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.2916666666666667,0.4696223316912972

In my opinion,  I prefer reading to listening to audiobooks. I think that using audiobook is more expensive than reading a book. You need to buy the audiobook reader such as kindle.  Audiobooks are sold and most of them have more expensive prices than I imagined.  If I just spend my time reading a book instead of listening to an audiobook, I can save money.  I think that reading is a cheap and convenient way.  To use audiobooks is an easy way but it can be complicated and expensive.  Also, reading is natural and you can enjoy it.  Listening to an audiobook is not a natural way like reading a book. For example, if you don’t understand what you hear, you can miss important information. Also, when I am in a car, listening to audiobooks make me feel bored because I can’t listen to them without paying my full attention.  My opinion is that listening to an audiobook can be useful, but reading a book is a much better way. Reading can be relaxing and self-paced. You don’t need to pay attention all the time and read anything you want. Reading makes your brain smarter too. It is possible you always have access to a book but you do not always have  a device with audiobooks in it. To conclude,  I prefer reading to listening to audiobooks.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have their reasons to participating in sports like these, and i dont feel it is really our choice to determine whether this reason is selfish or not. here are mprobably any reasons why people do extreme mountain climbing.
 One of the main reasons i believe is just for that adrenaline rush or thrill. That rush is something that is more than likely thereapeutic to them. The feeling of bliss when all you are focused on is just climbing that rock, the reason being if you fall you are probably going to be seriously injured or die. I can really understand someone who is doing it for this reason because it is a way to control your mental. I have participated in sports all my life as well, and i know for a fact it is what kept my mental sane. As soon as i stopped playing football after college, i had a huge missing gap in my life. One that i had from the age of 8 all the way through 22. I have learned so much about myself and know that i needed to find that another sport that gave me that feeling. This caused me to get into boxing. Boxing gave me the same sort of adrenaline that cleared my mind and made me feel good and happy. Me personally, I would so much rather do something dangerous and scary than to be in my own head and be upset or depressed. I would rather sky dive from a plane, climb a mountain, fight a boxing match, or even run into a burning building than being in my own head and upset. So someone who does mountain climbing for the mental part of it directly correlates to my life directly. I dont think any sort of line can be drawn for what is reasonable and not because it is completely up to that person. Whether this person is a father of four, or a twenty year old with no kids. If this person is doing the sport for a mental benefit, or benefit of any kind, i think it is not selfish. A clear head is what ultimately allows someone to be the best version of themselves. Us making the decision on what someone can and can not do because it is deemed selfish, completely takes that choice away from the individuals. So in conclusion, i feel that it is not selfish to pursue risky sports likee extreme mountain climbing.

In my opinion, we are bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, as engaging with current events actually does something. It helps us be more aware of what is going on in the world and how we can help, so e are bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news bwand just care about our own things. For example, if there are some people in need of help in our society due to some tragic events, we can be informed with news and act accordingly to help those needy  people. If we don't read news, we shall become ignorant and miss the chance of helping needy people. Besides, sometimes there are government news and rules that we should be aware of. Only by keeping up with the news can we get those information and act appropriately.  If everyone keep up with the news, the society would be more cohesive and the world would advance better.

---

In my opinion, we aren't being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens.

News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. 

I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way.

I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information.

Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides.

I think this way because over time the news has just turned me off and never made me want to watch it again. I hate the news. If something is very important I'll see it on social media or a family member will tell me about it. It is my personal preference to avoid the news and I highly doubt that is going to change.",27,6,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.7777777777777778,0.0,0.45823389021479716

""We're all going to get...old!"" She could barely get the word out. Like it was a curse. I felt a twinge of pity for her.

My dawning sense of dread was only slightly assuaged by the fact that I was too old to really feel the repercussions of this. I'd be dead before it really got bad. I pressed the button on my phone to call the assistant in my home. I loved it here, I mused, as I waited for her to respond. This retirement community was the perfect place to hide out and live my last decade or two in peace. I pushed the button again. And again. Finally I called the front desk. A harried voice answered. 

""Is it an emergency?"" the woman squawked at me, ""You should call the police if it is. Nobody's coming! Everyone left!"" I sat up. ""What did you say?""

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students.

In my opinion, schools should not be required to provide free pads or tampons. I think that it is a good idea for schools to have free pads and tampons on hand, but I don’t think that they should be required to provide them to every student. 

Schools are ultimately a place of learning. They don't have the responsibility to feed or clothe children-this is the parents' duty. Schools could provide period products as a last resort, similar to school lunches for impoverished students.  

Parents are responsible for providing their kid with number 3 pencils,  school clothes, and lunch. They are also responsible for providing their child with pads and tampons. If parents are unable to provide these items, then the child should be able to go to the school nurse and ask for them, but only if their parents have forgotten them.  Period products are cheap- a 100 pack from Walmart costs less than an hour of minimum wage work. 

Parents are the providers, schools are the educators. A clean separation of these makes it easier for the student and parents to understand personal responsibilities. Each child is unique, and parents will know their kids best. They provide personalized attire, learning tools, and food, and should teach reproductive responsibility as well. 

Period products should be like spare pencils-available at the school, but only as a last resort. ",20,7,9,0,4,12,4,8,2,2,0.0,0.45,0.2,0.5273972602739726

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I think that people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV. I mean really, how many times have you seen commercials that portray animals in suffering left by their owners, or in really bad caged up situations. That really tugs at a persons heart strings, at least it does mine. Now how many times have you seen commercials portraying human suffering of people in lets say, North Korea where it is know to be really bad. I can not say I have ever seen one.  That's why I think that is why people relate more to animal abuse because it is more publicized on TV.

I also think it might be because people do not really see tourists nearly as much as an animal, and if they do, for the most part tourists seem to be having the time of their life.

I do not think it is really ok to put animal suffering above human suffering though. Both are problems, and both should be addressed for sure. I do think that we should put more focus on human suffering though. Just because most of us do not have to deal with the bad treatment on a daily basis, doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to it. 

Maybe if we treated people better, people would also treat animals better because they would care more and be more empathic to all living creatures of this world. Humans are animals as well. Let's not forget that.",20,7,8,0,5,6,5,1,1,4,0.0,0.4,0.25,0.4820936639118457

I would say that it is not inherently wrong that people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals than that of people, given that many animals are powerless and not considered as able as people. Many might believe that their efforts to resolve human suffering is more futile than their efforts to end suffering towards animals, based on the innate nature of such issues facing the world. The suffering of humans is inherently much more complex and difficult than that of animal suffering, thus it is to be expected that many believe that animal welfare can be achieved must easily and faster than human welfare. As long as people still focus on both, even if it is asymmetrical, both goals can be achieved in due time. There will still be many in the world that will focus their attention on resolving issues plaguing human welfare, and many that have the resources and time to do so.  

However, it is still critical to acknowledge the lack of empathy and or consideration of others in people are around the world. For this apathy and indifference to others leads to the perpetuation of events such as genocide, poverty, and many more. This is to be resolved through initiatives and organizations such as the United Nations, which aims to promote peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation in solving. This organizations and charities can help bring attention to critical causes that affects humans and their welfare, and I believe many do take head of such endeavors to assist if they can. For people have the means to focus on a variety of different issues, tackling them as they see fit. Their focus needs not be limited to one cause, but can be spread out to many. For that, it is not wrong of them to care about animal welfare alongside the welfare of other human beings. 

Regardless, it is understandable that many would take it to resolve animal suffering versus the suffering of other human beings, given what factors are seen in both that affects how they resolve. Attention must still be present of both issues, and people should be informed to be empathetic and aware that both needs to be resolved with urgency.",20,7,10,0,3,8,3,5,0,3,0.0,0.5,0.15,0.4407484407484408

 However, to the alien's disappointment, he is not promoted. Instead, the aliens start to promote Matt even more than the alien is promoted. The alien gets very angry and frustrated, because he worked hard to try to make Matt a celebrity, only to watch him make it on his own. 
The alien goes to Matt's house, where Matt is relaxing by the pool, and tells him that he feels that he has been cheated
. Matt says that the alien's plan to make him a celebrity worked perfectly, and he could not have done it better himself. The alien is upset that Matt seems to be so dismissive of his feelings and thus decides to ban Matt from planet Zog and return him to planet Earth. This quite frankly seems to be the best solution. So, the alien returns Matt to Earth. Humanity is overjoyed to see Matt back again. They welcome him back with open arms and throw a worldwide party for him featuring delicacies and treats like hamburgers and French fries and pizza and beer, which are all foods that Matt loves. And that is how Matt ended up back on planet Earth after his long journey away. ",39,1,14,0,24,35,32,3,3,29,0.0,0.358974358974359,0.6153846153846154,0.3765432098765432

In my opinion, it is not selfish to participate in an extreme sport. People have their reasons for participating in sports like these and i dont think anyone should be limited as to what they can and can not do. It is simply their own decision. I know i personally have participated in violent sports all my life. I played football from the time i was a kid through graduating in college, and I am now doing boxing. To me, it is therapeutic to participate in sports like these because they challenge my mind and my athleticism. Working out to become better athlete is something that has always given me a goal, and something to drive for. In addition to that, i like to push myself and realize that if i can push myself in exercise, then i can anytime i am having a difficult time in life. I would guess that many people who do extreme sports are adrenaline junkies in a way, and need this sort of action in their life as they cant get it from every day tasks. This in turn calms their mind and allows them to have something to look forward to that quenches their adrenaline. I just think that everyone has a purpose for what they do, and it is not someone else to tell them what they can and can not do. Of course there are situations where the action can be looked at as selfish, but to them it may not me. There could be a dad who has four kids, but still does mountain climbing. Maybe he wants to be a role model to the kids and show them how to face their fears. Or maybe he simply wants to calm his mind so he can be present, and be a good father. Not everyone does it for these good and genuine reasons, but who are we to pick and choose? If its bad choice in your opinion, then no one is making you watch the action. 

So as far as drawing a line, i would simply say that the person themselves should draw it. People make bad decisions everyday doing things they should not do, thats part of life. I think it can be selfish to pursue things like risky sports, but it depends on perspective. From the outside in it may seem selfish, but to them it may not. Sometimes it truly may be selfish to them as well, but we simply are not in their shoes and dont really have the right to dictate that in my opinion. I think that once you start telling people they cant do what they want to, or limiting their right to choose, then you are taking away their heart in a way. Just think of the situation today. People are literally not doing things they know would be smart, simply because they dont want to be told what to do. Wearing masks for example. Yea it may be difficult for some people, but i would assume most people would agree that if it has any impact on lessening chances of gaining COVID, why not wear them, at least for our senior citizens. Shoot, ill wear a mascot costume if i am going to save people's lives.  o sum this all up, i would say that anything can be selfish if you look at it in that way.
 I know that may seem very general, but i simply feel that everyone has a perspective that matters. It is not our right to judge whether someone is being selfish or not simply by participating in a certain sport.",35,5,27,0,3,5,3,2,3,0,0.0,0.7714285714285715,0.08571428571428572,0.425

Does this mean that some other totally random person I don't know at all is my actual father? 
I quickly scour the list to see if there is any other name that looks like my dad's.
 But I come up short every time I look. Increasingly panicky, I call my mom. I ask her if my dad is really my biological father. She's very confused and asks me why I would even ask such a thing. I tell her that the mug that I have is giving me a ranking of all the dads in the world, and my father is not on the list. My mom sounds nervous. She tells me that it must be some kind of mistake. She tells me that I should just ignore the mug. But hearing my mom's nerves on the phone is not giving me any sense of comfort. I decide to just go ask my dad about it in person.

 My dad is just as confused as I am when I tell him that the mug doesn't have his name on the list. ""That's just not true,"" he retorts. But I pull out the mug and show it to him. I ask him if he can find his name on the list. He doesn't know what to say. I finally tell him that I'm going to speak with my mom again. He says he needs to speak with her as well but that he will do so privately. I ask what the matter is and he says, in a totally deflated way, that he isn't sure he can trust my mom again. I ask why he wouldn't trust my mom. He says that if he's not my father then that must mean that my mom had an affair or cheated on him. I ask how he's sure of that. He says that there's no other explanation that makes sense. After all, my mom and dad had been married for over five years by the time my mom got pregnant with me. He says that if my mom cheated on him, then she probably had an affair with my biological father. This whole situation sounds so sticky, so I reach out to my mom again and immediately request we talk in person. When we meet for lunch, I demand to know why my father is not listed on that mug.

I tell her that she needs to basically get her life together and that I am disgusted by her behavior. She says she understands and that she will never forgive herself.   But I am not interested in hearing it. I just want to be done with this woman. I ask how she could have done this to my father. She hurt a man for decades just to conceal her own lies!

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is not as good as reading a book the good old fashion way.  n audiobook is like watching a movie inn your head, where reading a book is like directing that movie in your head. In my experience, reading a book helps to enhance the visual pictures my head paints because while reading you are more often than not more focused on reading than just listening. While something is read to me, my mind tends to drift towards thinking about other things. Reading it myself my mind drifts off into what I am reading.

On a more educational point about listening to an audiobook, over reading it yourself, you do not get the same mind sharping skills. What I mean by that is when you are reading, it helps to expand your vocabulary, and improve your reading skills. Because of how the sentences are written, while you read them, you can take the time to ask questions like ""who is this person?"", helping to improve your problem solving skills quicker as well. While listening to a book the narrator sometimes talks really fast, so I feel as if you lose the benefits enjoyed from reading a book. There is also a kind of satisfying feeling that comes from flipping the crisp pages of a new book. Even the feel of the pages of a timeless classic. Another thing, how nice does an audiobook smell? I love the smell of a freshly printed book.",20,7,9,0,4,4,4,0,3,1,0.0,0.45,0.2,0.5250836120401338

In my opinion, there is no sport that is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least not that I know of. At the end of the day, there shouldn't be a line.

Football isn't really considered an extreme sport but there are many who won't let their children play due to the risks involved. I totally understand that point of view. 

So in reality, I think we all just draw our own lines in that situation. Some people are thrill seekers. Some people like myself are afraid to take risks.

How are we supposed to tell other people what decisions are right and wrong for them to make? We are all adults. We all have the freedom to make our own decisions. 

There are people that love to go sky diving. They know the risks of sky diving going in. They weigh those risks and think that the reward is greater than the risk. For me, the risk would be way too much. You'll never catch me diving out of a plane.

Football, basketball, hockey, baseball, snowboarding, skateboarding, etc. All of those sports are fine IMO. Ultimate Fighting is fine. We all get to decide what is too extreme for us personally, but we can't decide that for others. 

Extreme Mountain Climbing is dangerous. You can't prevent people from doing it. Climbing Mount Everest can lead to death because of how difficult it is. Everyone who goes to climb it knows that. Risk is sometimes what drives those people to take on those difficult tasks. They live for the adrenaline. 

We all make our own decisions and that's part of what makes life great. That can't be changed, especially for something like sports. ",32,5,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.84375,0.0,0.5245901639344263

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I have seen in movies in particular that I dislike the most and that is the African-American ""thug/criminal"" character. I have seen this character in movies and television shows for as long as I can remember. It has become far less common in the 2000s, but I still see it from time to time. Many movies, especially action and suspense genres, have a storyline centered around a criminal who must be caught in order to restore justice for someone. So often in these movies the people trying to catch the criminal are white and the antagonist is black. The black character is usually portrayed as a violent, uneducated, and unintelligent person who is only out for himself. Seeing this stereotype makes me cringe so much because how people are portrayed on screen has the ability to affect how they are seen by a population. If a person sees a black character portrayed as violent and unintelligent, they may believe that all black people are violent and unintelligent. This seems simplistic, but it is already a false narrative that exists that affects the lives of black men. I'm horribly offended if I see it on a big screen because it feels like it is reinforcing the false narrative that exists. 
Another reason the portrayal of this stereotype bothers me is because it is a stereotype that is often used to justify the mistreatment of black people. There are numerous stats proving that our country has a history of using the law to overcriminalize black males and to give them harder sentences on average than white males doing the same crimes. Filmmakers should really know better than make these types of characters come to life in a movie in a way that makes it seem common, when that is so far from the truth. 
In sum, seeing the black male criminal stereotype on the big screen makes me cringe more than any other because I know that overuse of these characters has had a negative impact on society and it's downright wrong.",17,4,8,0,5,5,5,0,1,4,0.0,0.47058823529411764,0.29411764705882354,0.5116279069767442

In my opinion, it is up to an individual to decide what risks are appropriate when it comes to extreme sports. I am of the belief that you have a right to play whatever sport you want to play, just as long as you are personally willing to accept whatever happens. And no, it is not selfish. 
Mountain climbing can be a very rewarding activity, both physically and mentally. A lot of people benefit from the focus and presence it takes to perform such an a task. The sense of accomplishment one can feel from a challenging climb can be life enriching, so much that a select few even devote their life to it. Surely challenging yourself is not selfish. 
Many extreme sports that are risky are far less risky with proper training and gear. If a person takes the time to learn these things and use helmets and pads when it applies, or let's say learn to climb using the proper gear and techniques then the risk factor of the activity goes way down. Many accidents occur not because of the sport itself, but because it was done wrong. It is not selfish or nearly as risky to take the proper precautions. 
A suppose a line can be drawn in some cases, where people are just looking for a thrill by doing something likely to hurt them. I have seen the Tik-Tok videos of people up to some pretty crazy things just to get a thrill, like jumping off of a roof onto a trampoline, or someone trying to take a motorbike up a poorly constructed ramp and I don't think these are sports at all and do not apply to what I have discuss. Let's not confuse childish stunts with extreme sports that are more mindfully executed. 
In conclusion, no, it is not selfish at all to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. They are enjoyed by many and people that enjoy them do so because of the challenge benefit they experience, and in my opinion that is not selfish.",20,5,9,0,6,7,7,0,3,4,0.0,0.45,0.3,0.5107398568019093

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing to learn in school are basic everyday life concepts that our kids nowadays are severely lacking. Kids nowadays know how to TikTok and know every detail on their favourite movie (for example people such as Miranda Sings) but they have no idea what mistakes to avoid or how to handle different situations such as filing their taxes, registering to vote, or making sure who they vote for actually represents their opinions, or how to succeed in their job.

It's absolutely critical to have our usual subjects such as science and math, which are worth everything in today's world, but kids should also learn other subjects that I think are just as important, even though they get pretty much no attention anywhere, such as civics or politics, or how to achieve things rather than narcissistic topics. There should be a restructuring in how students get admitted to college. Instead of relying on the one board exam they do, which often tests knowledge in irrelevant areas, kids should be evaluated on how they handle themselves in their high school and how they interact in a team environment. Because in reality, the student's lifetime careers involve them working in more group projects than they will ever deal with on an exam.

Let's also not forget that other life-saving lessons such as how to last in relationships, knowing how to deal with authority, and how to handle losing should be taught in schools for students' benefit. There are too many examples that I am sure you know about news of kids that are getting pregnant or struggling through relationships striking over social media. There are also a stark anger towards the police and how others see them, which I think stems from a lack of knowledge that authorities have rights to stop people just as much as you do, and that people are being falsely arrested because of this.

And lastly, let's not forget all about how there are too many school shootings that are happening in our country. It's a very sad reality and I wish that at a very young age, our students get taught how to be aware of things that are happening around them, and that there are actual serious consequences to taking lives. It's too easy to be angry and to be in the wrong mindset, when instead they could have an open mind to hear both sides of a story, even if they are different from the ones they are brought up with. We should teach kids how to be tolerant to ideas that are different than theirs, because it's not often that they will be convinced to change, but they most certainly need to know how to live with people with vastly different mindset.

So there you have it, I think those three ideas that I have are the ones that should be taught more regularly in our schools today so that we could welcome more successful and more prepared bunch of our youth today to further tackle different issues in the future. The world is changing, and they need all the help they could get so that they could be equipped with the necessary knowledge to tackle the different obstacles that come their way, and could potentially make it actually past their teenage phase.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, technology is the most important subject that can be taught today because it is the future. It is literally in our everyday lives, and we use it everyday all the time. It is important to know how to use it and how it works. So it also helps to teach how to use it safely, because security is a big deal today. If you don't believe me ask all the people who have been hacked and lost bank accounts, social media accounts, game accounts, and even worse had their identities stolen right out from under them. That happens because some people do not understand technology, and how to use it properly and safely. 

Learning technology also helps set a person up for the future. I say that because there are not many jobs today that do not require some knowledge of how to use technology. Even the simple ones like working for McDonald's or other fast food or grocery stores.

Learning Technology can lead to even greater careers in peoples lives like being a computer programmer, a game developer, AI developer, scientist, engineer, doctor, and all those other kinds of high end paying jobs. 
Learning technology is also important because it helps people learn how to think outside the box.
 It can help you sharpen your problem solving skills. It can help you learn how to think logically and rationally, because you have to think like that to understand how computers work.

Technology is only growing more and more prominent in our lives, and isn't going away any time soon. So that is why I think that it is the most important to learn in school. Learn to live with it, and love it.",21,6,11,0,4,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.5238095238095238,0.19047619047619047,0.49421965317919075

In my opinion, if is vital if we are going to live in a functioning democracy, we all need to do our part and keep up with current events but also have the know how to accurately judge between objective reporting and opinionated reporting. We has an information crisis in our country/world right now. There is so much information out there that it is hard to know what to believe. The algorithms that feed us news just reinforce what we already believe since we are less likely  to read conflicting information. We are more likely to keep reading about what we already think and believe and then those beliefs just get stronger and stronger. We have come to a point where we can not agree on much anymore and it is tearing us apart. We need to be able to agree on some basic facts and then we can have a conversation about how we should move forward. The disconnect between the urban populations and rural populations are incredible. They believe almost the opposite of what the other believes. Its becoming more like tribalism then activism. So the less informed we are about objective information and the more we rely on our own news bubbles we will continue to fracture and the country will suffer terribly because of it.

Turns out no one really likes China being number one either. Countries that China took advantage of during World War III now want revenge.

One thing China didn't expect was the US to be so strong even after isolation. All of their military is still in place. The troops have been training. All the ships, tanks, and submarines are still theirs. And no countries like the UK, Japan, Canada, and many others want the US to be number one again. So they device a plan to attack China. China is still oblivious to all of this. They are in their own bubble thinking that everything is going swell. The plan is to attack China's capital when they least expect it.

Since all the guards are taken out the building is easily penetrated. They go in, subdue the guards, and capture the prime minister and others. China is easily outnumbered. 20 Chinese to the 100's of soldiers. The US makes it points clear. They want China to surrender. They want China to give up everything and will give them what they think is fair. If they do not comply they will all be executed due to their crimes from the last 50 years. China of course gives up and tell their allies to stand down and there is nothing they can do. China is defeated.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons. I am not a female, however i cant imagine what it would feel like to be trapped in school on your period that suddenly popped up, without any sort of tampon or pad. Especially a middle school girl who may not even know what is going on down there.  At this age, i think schools should do their best to make sure that the girls are supported in this way. Schools can be rough, and it would stink to have a girl get made fun of for something like this she could not control. Im not saying that you need to put the pads or tampons in a vending machine or something like that, but i think every school nurse should have them to hand out in case a girl needs them. I would say that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, and band aids because they are all essential type of products. What is a girl suppose to do if there were no such thing as tampons. She would probably have to just stick toilet paper or something in there. I dont think tampons and pads are overly expensive so there is really no reason why schools wouldnt be able to provide them and just buy them in bulk. If a school is even thinking about providing something like condoms, then they ought to have something like tampons. I just always think of the worst situation possible when it comes to these sorts of things, and i think of a girl who is thinking about just leaving school after something like this happens. I think of a girl who may bleed through her clothes and has nothing to change into. I know things like this must have happened before, so why not have a tampon that the girl can use to feel better and maybe even a change of pants. This would make a girl feel completely supported and really lessen the negative feeling associated with that day. It is a completely natural thing that happens, and they should not have to feel sorry for themselves about the situation. I would think most girls nowadays know about periods before they happen, but it would still be nice to be prepared. Thats a positive about social media i guess is that nothing is hidden. Young kids know about all of these things long before they become adults, so they are sort of desensitized to it. But i am sure there is still that one young girl who has been coddled and protected who would be completely thrown off when she sees blood down there.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that it is a good thing to focus on animal welfare because it can help us understand the way we treat animals and how we can change that.  Many animals species are on the verge of extinction. If we focus on animal welfare, we can help save many species of animals.

There's plenty of humans on the planet. By the year 2050, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion. In contrast, many species of animals are becoming extinct every day.

We don't need to worry about saving humans. We need to worry about saving animals.

I believe we know that we are harming animals, and feel guilty about it.  Many animals are loyal, non-polluting, and will be a true friend if you let them.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, someone who does not keep up with the news is not a bad citizen, but they cannot call themselves a good and responsible citizen either.   n other words, Ithink that everyone has some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, but I do not think that it is a requirement. to call oneself a citizen.

The news ultimately affects all of us, whether directly, or indirectly through the political process.  We cannot make good decisions without being informed, so I think that it is important for any responsible citizen to follow events in the news and to understand the historical underpinnings of events.  

If one does not follow the news in the world, and does not therefore understand what is happening, they will be apt to make bad decisions that not only affect themselves, but could potentially be harmful for others as well.  Think of the people who refuse to listen to scientific fact about vaccines.  They are the reason why Covid-19 has not been controlled in the United States, despite the fact that we have ample access to vaccines.  This lack of information, or more seriously, abundance of false information, has been literally deadly to many.
However, I do not think that it is necessary for everyone to be a news junkie.
  I think that it is important to be informed, but I do not think that it is necessary to know every detail of every story.  In fact, spending too much time concentrating on current events can actually be harmful in itself, since it would distract from other pursuits.  Getting too bogged down in the minutiae of up-to-the-minute events can also lead to a poor understanding of the events themselves, since one will not be able to step back and see the history.  One would not be seeing the forest because the trees are in the way, as the old saying goes.

My opinion of the news media is not strictly positive, though.  Media outlets, at best, chase ratings or (in the case of public broadcasting) donations from members, and this can lead them to focus on eye-catching reporting at the expense of important reporting.  Very few news outlets spend much time on budgetary concerns in government, or distant ethnic tensions, because readers are not interested, but if this information was pushed to the forefront, it could be beneficial to everyone.  

In addition, we cannot pretend that the news media is impartial and unbiased.  All persons are biased toward a certain viewpoint, and this bias can become entrenched when journalists have to please college professors and later editors who all tend to feel the same way.  When alternative media outlets pop up, they end up pushing brainless conspiracy theories instead of giving fact-based rebuttals to biases at other sources, because this is what their viewers want to hear.  And even when they act responsibly, highly partisan news sources often take an extreme position, even when they back it up with facts and evidence.  
In conclusion, I think that everyone has some responsibility to be informed about the world around them, but I do not think that it is necessary
 (or even wise) for them to spend the majority of their time on the news.  In addition, they need to be skeptical about what they hear in the news media, but even more skeptical about people who claim that the media are always wrong.  Finally, responsible citizens need to not only follow the news, but also try to get a deeper understanding of what led to current events.  Some of the time spent reading the newspapers would be better spent reading a book that chronicles the full story of a recent, or current, event.

You see the mug changing while you're eating a big breakfast which includes a stack of pancakes, French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hash browns. Yum! You study the mug to investigate your ranking. Things have been tough with your daughter Harper lately, because she's been acting out. Her mom Soeurette is about to get remarried in less than a month, and the wedding has put a lot of strain on your family because Soeurette is quite frankly crazy and mentally ill. You've been trying to be the best Dad you can be, but you're not sure if it's enough.

You see that you're ranked #530, and you're not sure how to feel about that because you're not sure what the rankings mean. After all, under any stretch of the imagination, you're not a bad Dad. You enjoy taking Harper out for ice cream cones and always let her order sprinkles and jimmies and whipped cream and crushed Oreos and chocolate sauce and cherries and gummy bears and M&Ms and Skittles and Mounds bars and Snickers bars and Reese's Pieces to add on top of her sundaes. You also enjoy taking Harper to the park to play and people watch. And anyways, how many dads are there in the world anyway? 
You look at the rankings again and see that you're ranked #530 out of 5,000,000,000.
 This means you are in an elite group of top dads. You're in the top 0.00000001% of all dads in the world. But at the same time, this means that there are 529 dads who are better at fatherhood than you, and you're not sure how to feel about that. You wish you could be a better dad to Harper since she deserves you to be the best dad in the world. So, you decide to do something about it. You ask Harper how she wants to spend her dream day with you and she says she wants to go to the zoo, the beach, and the park. You know this is a lot to fit in into one day but you're up for the challenge. So, the two of you set off on your adventure. You enjoy a fabulous day together laughing and bonding. You take Harper out for lunch at a great restaurant and you both order your favorite meals. For Harper, this is a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of French fries and a chocolate milkshake. And for you, this is a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. The two of you love chocolate milkshakes, what can you say? Harper is her father's daughter after all. Anyway, Harper ends up loving the day out. She tells you she really appreciates that you were willing to make the time for her today, because lately she's been feeling pushed to the side since Soeurette has been spending so much time with her fiancé and planning the wedding. You are happy to be there for your daughter. When you get home, you check your mug again. You are pleasantly surprised to see that you have moved up in the rankings. You are now ranked #499. You've cracked the top #500! This is a feat that calls for celebration, so you take the rest of the night off to celebrate and relax with a glass of wine.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I would not say we are bad citizens for keeping up with the news. I would say that we are slightly irresponsible in a worldly, or even local way if we don't keep up with the news though. That is because we are not being informed of what is going on in our community, and we are not able to make the best decisions for ourselves, our family, and our community.

If we do not keep up with the news, we could end up making bad choices without even being aware that we are making a bad choice. For example, if we are not aware of the current events in our community, we could end up moving into a bad neighborhood, or buying a house that is in a very bad school district, or without knowing there is a high crime rate where we are moving. Another example of not paying attention to the news is that we could end up buying a product that is not good for us, or even buying a product that is made in a way that is not good for the environment.

What if we are not news conscience, and we take a trip abroad to a foreign country, and missed a US travel advisory saying that there is a high risk of being kidnapped in that country, or even a high risk of catching a disease that is really contagious and spreading fast in that country. Then we are seriously putting ourselves, and maybe our family at a high risk of serious complications. What would people do, because they were unaware of what was going on in the world around them.  
I think that we are responsible for keeping up with the news, because it is our responsibility to be informed about what is going on iaround us, at least for most of the time. As a matter of fact, I read a news article just the other day about some serious Joker virus that was infecting Android smartphone applications. It drains people's bank accounts. If I didn't read the news about, I would not have known that my wife had one of those apps on her phone, and we would have been clueless about where our money went.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the line really depends on the person. Some people will have an opinion that extreme sports are way too dangerous and other people will have an opinion that nothing is too dangerous. I personally would never participate in an extreme sport. I do not like taking risks at all. I don't even fly in an airplane. There's no way that I'm going to participate in a sport where there is serious risk at injury.

However, I understand that there are other people who are adrenaline junkies. Some people love to go sky diving for example. They live for that thrill. While I think those people are out of their minds, they truly love it.

I don't think there really is a line. Ultimately we all make individual choices. If someone asks me to go sky diving, I make the choice to say no. Just like they make the choice to say yes.

So I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. At least I don't know of one. You can break your bones skiing or snowboarding and I consider those sports. You can break your bones playing football and hockey. Those are considered sports by basically everyone.

So again, we all make our own lines. What I consider to be too dangerous many others wouldn't consider to be dangerous at all. That's what makes humans great though. We are all different in so many different ways.

You draw your line when it comes to extreme sports. Ultimately, everyone should do what makes them happy. I am happy not taking risks. If you are happy taking risks, go for it.

In my opinion, absolutely, without a doubt being an active citizen should involve relatively knowing about how the world works. Especially when you live in a democracy. In order to navigate the world and make rational desc ions you have to have knowledge of how certain things work. Right now there are a few ways to go about doing this and watching the news is a good way to learn about the world. It shows people the world outside their surrounding area. It gives insights into peoples lives that you would not normally have access to. It teaches us about our rights and options as a nation/civilization. The news shows us what is going on in the world in general and how it affects us. Without this information, we would not know about severe weather, local issues and especially international news and how it can affect us. 
I have to give this a hard yes, that in order to be a so called good citizen you need to stay informed atleast to some degree.

104,c9e301f54a8a4723b14567a99c90d2b7.jsonl,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf wasn't too happy to learn that the little pig's house was built out of depleted uranium. After all, what good was such a house to him? He knew he would never be able to blow a house like this down and thus it would make it very difficult to make a snack out of the little pig. Of course, the little pig was a smart little creature and understood that was the whole point of building his house out of depleted uranium. 

The wolf was a bit frustrated when he realized that he'd need to find another way to make a snack out of the little pig. So he decided to try to trick the little pig into coming outside. He decided to figure out what the little pig's favorite foods were. He found out that the little pig's favorite foods were pizza, beer, and ice cream. One day, the wolf came by the little pig's house with some ingredients to make homemade pizza. The wolf was like, ""hey little pig, I have some ingredients to make homemade pizza. You want to come outside and help me make it?"" The little pig laughed. Why would he come outside his house to make pizza? It wasn't as though there was an oven built into his backyard. But the wolf gestured at the pig through the little pig's window and showed the pig that he had brought an outdoor grill with him. ""I was thinking we could grill the pizzas together,"" he said. The little pig was intrigued. Grilled pizza was delicious! To seal the deal, the wolf said, ""I also have an ice chest full of cold beers and pints of Ben and Jerry's."" The little pig was sold. The little pig opened up his door and approached the wolf. The wolf said, ""I'm glad you decided to come outside. I was afraid you were going to be a stick in the mud about this."" The little pig laughed and said, ""I'm not a stick in the mud. I'm just smart enough to know that if I came outside, you'd eat me."" The wolf smiled at the little pig. ""So then what made you change your mind about coming outside?"" he asked. The little pig smiled back. ""Once I saw how much food you brought over, I figured that you'd just get full eating pizza and drinking beer and eating ice cream. I figured you couldn't eat all that and eat me too. And besides, I love all these foods!"" The wolf smiled at how gullible and ignorant the little pig was. The little pig's greed for the food had tricked the little pig into thinking that the wolf had a much smaller appetite than he actually had. In truth, the wolf had plenty of room in his stomach to eat lots of pizza in addition to the little pig. The wolf said, ""that's great, little pig. Let's get started on making the pizzas."" While the wolf rolled out dough, the little pig spread sauce and cheese. But suddenly, the wolf turned to the little pig. ""Hey little pig, I just realized that I forgot to bring the pepperoni. Do you have any suggestions?"" The little pig shrugged. He wasn't a huge fan of pepperoni. But then the wolf said, ""I have an idea! I know exactly where I can get pepperoni."" The little pig was confused. ""Where?"" he asked. The store was closed that day so there was nowhere close to get pepperoni. The wolf laughed. ""I can get it right from you."" And he licked his lips and ate the little pig in a flash, teaching the little pig a lesson about greed. 
The moral of the story is that if you're a little pig, you should never trust a wolf.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

While I have not ever experienced period shaming or period poverty, I know that such incidents exist from the perspectives of my close friends and the people I have interacted with in my life. I can emphasize nonetheless with their stigmas, and feel that such incidents should be prevented for females students for what is effectively a natural and widespread human experience. To prevent such stigmas and negative social demeaning,schools should provide free pads and tampons to students.
 Such items are relevant to the interests of schools as institutions of learning, and are necessary for the health and well-being of students that cannot easily afford such items. In addition, many students should view schools as safe environments for them to learn and interact with fellow students, for often they might lack such comfort at home or elsewhere in their life. By roviding free pads and tampons to students., they can ensure that female students can feel supported during a stressful time in their life, that they are unfamiliar with at times and potentially do not have the financial means to afford the items that alleviate the symptoms of periods. 
Pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools.
 For the most part, pads and tampons do not need to be inherently viewed as negative or dangerous. Pads and tampons intend to stop bleeding from staining clothes, similar to how Band-Aids do for other parts of the body. They are essentially hygienic items, and should be viewed as such to the same degree people view toilet paper, soap, and other items that are used frequently to maintain hygiene. The main difference between pads and tampons relate to the fact that they are used for a more private and personal purpose, and are not as readily available in stores. In a school setting, pads and tampons ought to be distributed in a discreet manner, not disclosing the female students identity when they request for them, nor telling the other students that said student needs free pads or tampons. Unlike the usage of toilet paper, Band-Aids, and soap, tampons and pads as mentioned can be a source of ridicule and bullying for the students. Despite the widespread use of pads and tampons, there are still many people who view them as taboo or dirty, especially male students that are in middle or high school. In any case, schools should still provide pads and tampons based on the benefits they bring to female students that require them and cannot access them by personal finances or means. Schools should take great efforts to avoid incurring stigmatization towards female students that request such products, by maintaining their confidentiality and privacy when asking and receiving the products.",22,7,8,0,7,8,7,1,2,5,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.3181818181818182,0.42748091603053434

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, Cho Chang from the Harry Potter franchise is a great archetype for a stereotypical and offensive character. Not only is her name a non-realistic name for a real Asian person to have, but she is also a stereotypical Asian character who is not only weak, but also has no real personality; essentially, she is a character who is only there to be Harry Potter's love interest and nothing more. Her race adds nothing to the narrative except to make her extra alluring and strange, which devalues all that people of color have to offer to stories. As a person of color myself, it's disturbing to be forced time and time again to remember what the outside, racially normative world thinks of me and people like me.

It's difficult to know in advance what kinds of media will contain offensive portrayals of people, but it is definitely true that offensive depictions are not worth the suffering and annoyance. I would not watch or read something that had a stereotypical character in it, because I would not want to support the idea that people of color are caricatures to be thrown into a narrative like a spice instead of an ingredient.  Whether it's exotifying a character of color to make them mysterious or different with no real substance, whether it's hypersexualizing or desexualizing a character in line with axes of historical oppression against their kind, or whether it's something as lazy as giving them two surnames for a name instead of a legitimate first name and a family name, racist writing tropes signal to me as a reader that an author has no integrity as a writer and is too unbothered to even do cursory research or imagine their own characters as thee-dimensional, multifaceted beings. It's not worth my time to slog through such low-brow works when there are better works out there with better representation.

When media works fail even the simplest tests of verisimilitude,  they fail at the most basic level. If an author is to demonstrate that they are not interested in creating a work that is meaningful or relevant to the audience, then they don't deserve anybody's time of day. As a conglomerate of readers, viewers, and audience members, we have a duty to direct our attention to works that try and that succeed in the very basic goal of being sincere and realistic towards us in turn.",14,4,7,0,3,10,4,6,2,2,0.0,0.5,0.21428571428571427,0.5133928571428571

In my opinion, i do not find it selfish to puruse risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. Even though they may seem dangerous, i think everyone has their reasons for doing them. Some people need that level of extreme to feel calm and peaceful in their mind, and without it they may not be the same type of person as they are with it. Something like mountain climbing, so dangerous that your life is on the line requires a certain level of attention that just wipes out the rest of your stressors in your head. Some people are naturally more stressed than other people and to them a coping strategy may be something like the dangerous sport of mountain climbing. So to me, it is not selfish to participate in any risky sport. It does depend on the reason you are doing it of course, but I dont think it is our decision to decide whether someone's reason is selfish or not. This is something that is for them to decide. I can personally relate to this state of mind because i need exercise and sports myself to calm my mind. There is something about that extreme focus that is just very therapeutic to me in general. I played football all my life, and this gave me something to focus on from the time i was eight years old, to the time i was 22. Right after playing i needed to find that something that gave me the same feeling, or identity.  For this reason i got into boxing. Boxing was the only thing that could give me that same feeling. I needed that extreme focus to be able to function in my daily life. I started to realize that being in my own head and being stressed was 1000 times worse than anything that could happen in that boxing ring. I was never afraid of getting hurt in any sport, i was simply afraid of being in my own head. I would do anything just not to be in my own head. So i definitely get the person that is doing mountain climbing for peace of mind and for that adrenaline rush that some of us so desperately need. That rush that we can not get outside of the sport. I think that is why we do it. I think that is why we do anything, for that positive feeling or consequence. Doing it in that way is not selfish at all, it is selfless. So in conclusion, i truly believe that it is not selfish to pursue risky sports as long as it is done for the right reason.

The fighting went on for days, which then turned to months. Many were seriously injured from the fighting, while countless relationships including friendships and other social interactions were soured. However, once again, the mugs ended up changing once again.

This time, the mugs all showed a different number, for some being quite higher or lower than others. Posts were made again online , with people showing off their new mug. People were confused if the ranks were updated based on what had occurred since the first time. They also wondered if the mugs would change once again.

Those that believed the mugs would change were correct, as three months later the ranks were updated again. The same was true after three more months since then. People concluded that the changing months updated and reflected the rank of dads around the world , every three months. This would end up having a positive change on the world, as people began to accept their rank, and the possibility they could improve it. While some dads would still fight and argue for their rank, they eventually realized it was futile as they would get a lower rank the next time the mugs of the world changed. The dads of the world sought to be better fathers and parents, to raise the ranks higher before the next time the mugs updated, so they could once again have a mug even for a short time that said #1 Dad again.",23,1,16,0,6,9,6,3,0,6,0.0,0.6956521739130435,0.2608695652173913,0.4024144869215292

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. It all started one fateful evening, for the shapeshifter. For them, it was no problem getting a date. For whatever person they encountered, it was a matter of turning into their heart's desire, their heartthrob, or dream date. They could be anyone, and it was easy to get a date. However, the shapeshifter desired more, they wanted something long term. No matter who they dated, they never seemed to personally connect with their date. That was, until they met a special woman, sitting by herself at the bar. The shapeshifter was instantly smitten, and decided to make a move. They shifted into a young man, no older than her, and a form they had commonly used in the past. Perhaps they saw a model they wished to emulate, or it was an ex from a former date, they no longer knew at that time.

The shapeshifter approached the woman, and struck up a conversation. She was an artist, struggling at times, but looking for love nevertheless. She had only been in a relationship once before, but broke it off due to how abusive her ex was towards her. She was looking for someone who would treat her right, and be there for her, to avoid her previous relationship. The shapeshifter acknowledged her desire, having no interest in ever harming her, or letting any harm befall her. 

And so they hit it off, going date after date. He got to know her more personally, but she would truly never get to know the real him. For as a shapeshifter, he could never tell her the truth about who he was. Perhaps that was the real reason she would break up with them in the future, despite her insistence that she was not ready for a relationship. 

So the shapeshifter tried again soon after, with a new form and a new identity. However, no matter what they tried, it seemed the outcome with the artist remained the same. She would always say that she was not ready for a relationship, and that she wanted to focus on her art. The shapeshifter found themselves rejected over and over again by the same woman, despite trying different forms each time. 
The shapeshifter was at a loss, and didn't know what else to do.
 They felt desolate, and empty, no longer filled with the same drive as they felt the moment they first laid eyes on the woman. Perhaps, they thought, it was simply not meant to be. They would continue to date other people, but they would never feel the same way about anyone else as they did about the artist. They eventually stopped trying to date others, and focused on themself. They even decided to take on a more permanent form, to truly discover who they really are. They made friends, ones that truly felt close and personal, and people they could rely on. For a while, they truly felt happy. One day, they went out for drinks with their friends to a new bar. They were all sitting at the bar, talking, when the artist walked in.

The shapeshifter turned to look at the artist, who looked no different than the last time they saw her. She sat next to him, and they ordered her a drink. Smiling, the artist introduced herself to the shapeshifter, a name they had already known all too well. Grabbing their drink, they decided they will give love one more chance. This time, the shapeshifter thought, they will try being themselves for a change, and see if the artist would accept them for who they are. They would no longer try to be anyone else, and they would no longer hide their true identity from the artist. For once in their life, they would try to confine fully in another person, the person they believed for the longest time would be their soul mate.",42,2,31,0,9,13,9,4,3,6,0.0,0.7380952380952381,0.21428571428571427,0.40257879656160456

The woman's friend is still not convinced.
 She tells her friend that people who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The conversation ends and the woman decides after some deep thought that she needs to test this guy, soon. There would be no point dragging things out just to experience the same disappointment once again.

They prefer to focus on different things and that is just fine as long as they dont try to influence the system with unsupported claims. aving some basic grasp of what is going on is quite useful. but not necessary to becoming a ""good"", productive, law abiding citizen.

Some people may just be burnt out from information overload that they check out and dont pay attention anymore and I can not blame those people. Its one thing to keep up with current events, its another to compulsorily consume it. I'm sure there are plenty of people who get along just fine without keeping up with current events. They maybe doing better then some of us psychologically who do keep up with the news on a daily basis. Some news outlets are just more about keeping our attention then giving us things of substance. There are so many confilicting views, I can see how people would tune out. So I say no to being a bad person if you do not keep up with the news.

---

In my opinion, it is the responsibility of a good citizen to keep up with the news.   I think it is important to know what is going on in the world because it can affect us.  For example, there are many pieces of legislation that are passed that can have bad current and future affects on the population.  Due to people not keeping up with the news, the public isn't aware of the effects of the legislation until it is too late.  There are many instance where the public becomes aware of a bad bill and they are able to apply pressure to their government representatives to make changes before it is too late.

Keeping up with the news also allows the public to stay informed about issues such as climate change.  We are far behind when it comes to dealing with climate change.  I believe we would be mounting a better challenge to climate change if more people were knowledgeable about the effects.  This knowledge could be garnered from the news.  

When you have areas of the world that are experiencing historical high water levels due to climate change, there are often news reports being done on these subjects.  If the public is not paying attention, the public will probably not put pressure on their government representatives to act. 

I believe that people who go through life oblivious to the problems that surround them are not good people.  The news often focuses on problems that may not be a problem for certain individuals--yet.   It is always a good thing to see what issues other people are going through.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the things that we are typically taught in school are pretty pointless. I know that personally I haven't used much of what I learned in school. The number one subject that I think is important to learn in school is math.

Math is essential. We use it every day. I disagree with some of the ways that it is taught in school though. We should be learning things that are valuable. For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages.

We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. 

There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived.

The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company.

I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School. I was placed into the Computer Science program at my University from Day One.

My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. 

These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. 

School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules. That sets a standard that they will have to follow when they become adults. 

The school system is valuable, but it bothers me to this day that it is an imperfect one that is built off of greed and ignorance in my opinion. ",34,6,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.8235294117647058,0.0,0.4541577825159915

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes that are portrayed in works of fiction are generally not intended to be harmful, and may come about unconsciously, but they do exacerbate feelings that lead to discrimination against, and sometimes direct harm to, marginalized groups in society.  For this reason, I would generally prefer not to watch or read something that revels in stereotypes, but sometimes I endure such things because of the cultural or entertainment value.  I suspect that if I was a member of a marginalized group, or was otherwise directly affected, I might take a stronger stance against such works. 

I hrve already written at length about how I feel about stereotypes in general, so for today, I would like to talk about some of te most egregious instances of stereotyping in ymyreading or viewing experiences?.  
Please note that in all cases, I am not claiming negligence on the part of the author.
  I cannot know or predict what the author truly had in mind, but I will allow for the possibility (nay, the probability) that the author was simply relaying feelings that he or she had picked up from society.  The fact that society felt this way is not the author's fault, but I still take exception to the fact that the author reinforces these feelings.

So, onto the business at hand, the most common and harmful stereotype I see is that of black people.  This goes back to the Jim Crow era in which African-Americans were portrayed as happy fools who loved to work on plantations, where they could dance and sing in the sunlight.  Needless to say, this was never true, but it made white audiences feel better about themselves.  In this one case, I think that the stereotype was indeed created from willful malice.  

Hattie McDaniels's character in Gone with the Wind is another example.  She is portrayed as someone who would be helpless if she was not enslaved by a rich white family, and we are meant to believe that she is grateful for what she received.  However, this is also an instance in which a black woman was humanized and portrayed fairly respectfully on screen, so I cannot totally object to it.  
For a far more serious example, let us consider the trope of the ""black friend.""
  This is often a character who is portrayed with no depth, and simply exists to make the main characters (who are almost always white) appear to be more tolerant and worldly.  A black friend simply exists to make the audience think that the white characters are more popular and universally appreciated.  At times, the black friend even ends up having some connection to the underworld, which the main characters can harmlessly exploit.  This is just as bad as explicitly claiming that all black people are involved in crime, because that is what the audience is led to believe.  
The only possible situation in which I would tolerate a stereotype is if it were dportrayedby an obviously ignorant character ,win a fictional setting, ho could not be expected to know
 any better.  This might actually be beneficial for society, because audiences who came to see a heroic white cast, might end up learning a subtle lesson about questioning the stereotypes that pervade our society.  

Unfortunately, I cannot readily think of an example in which I have seen this happen in fiction, and there have been far to many examples of harmful stereotypes.  I hope that the few examples which I had time to share were illustrative of the broader point.",26,4,17,0,5,6,5,1,5,0,0.0,0.6538461538461539,0.19230769230769232,0.4913112164296998

In my opinion, the character of ""Mammy"" in Gone with the Wind makes me not want to watch the movie.  Gone with the Wind was created in a different time period so I understand that things were different then.  However, the character of ""Mammy"" just has too many negative stereotypes regarding African-Americans for me.  It makes the movies unwatchable.  It hurts me to see African-American characters that are portrayed in a way where they don't seem to have the mental faculties to be their own character.   They aren't portrayed as intelligent enough to be independent from the other characters who tend to be non-African-American.   

I think that the character of ""Mammy"" is a stereotype that should be left in the past.  If there are African-American characters in literature that lean too heavily into ""rap"" or ""street"" culture, without it being relevant to the story, then I don't like that.  I think that it is a stereotype that is not needed.  I will be turned away from watching or reading media that has those themes in it.

The president of the United States at the time, Soeurette Morley, was shocked to realize that such a thing could ever happen to the United States. 
Following the discovery, Soeurette invited all nations to a meeting in Las Vegas.
 She proclaimed that the United States had been cheated out of all economic development, growth and discovery over the last 50 years. After all, the United States had had zero contact with any other country over the past decades whereas many other countries had thrived by building complex channels for shipment and trade among themselves. The United States was at a severe disadvantage and needed to catch up with the rest of the world. Soeurette realized this and vowed to make the other countries pay for their desertion of the effort to isolate for 50 years. She declared that the United States would embark on a campaign of global conquest to force all other nations into servitude. 
To lead the newly formed U.S. Empire, Soeurette appointed herself supreme ruler.
 She appointed her ruthless brother, T.J. Morley, as the military commander and charged him with conquering all nations on Earth. She also appointed her daughter, Harper Campbell, as the commander of all spaceborne forces. Soeurette was excited to get her empire grooving. 
The Campbell family was a long line of military leaders, and Harper followed suit.
 Harper absolutely dominated spaceborne forces, much to Soeurette's delight. She then got word that the Campbell family had a history of mental illness. Well, that was a problem. Soeurette could not risk the possibility that Harper was insane. After all, insanity might jeopardize the future of the U.S. Empire and put Soeurette's status as supreme ruler at risk. Soeurette called upon the great doctors of her empire to help her.

The doctors studied Harper and determined that Harper was indeed unfit to be the ruler of spaceborne forces. Soeurette reluctantly replaced Harper with her ex-husband, Tyler Campbell. Tyler ruled with a steady hand but was at least stable. Soeurette and Tyler fought all the time at first over their strategy. Soeurette eventually gave up and let Tyler take the lead. And that is when a romance was rekindled between Soeurette and Tyler. They would fight with each other and then make love, only to repeat the process over again. Soeurette eventually fell in love with Tyler all over again. She wanted to undo their divorce. Tyler, however, had just started dating someone else. Soeurette was furious. She felt betrayed and let down by Tyler. 
Soeurette commandeered an army of tanks and stormed Tyler's abode.
 Tyler's new girlfriend was crushed by one of the tanks. Tyler retaliated and fired a rocket launcher at Soeurette, blasting her to pieces. And that was the end of Soeurette's strategy to take over the world as supreme leader of the U.S. Empire. Her plans were never able to come fully to fruition because of her own emotional instability and thorny romantic past. 
Tyler, as the new ruler of the U.S. Empire, had to deal with his ex-wife's demise.
 However, Tyler was smarter than Soeurette had been, and he generally had a more calm and steady demeanor. He immediately passed resolutions that increased the U.S.'s connections and ties with other states, rather than threatening to blockade them all. He also immediately repealed all legislation that would have created a global dictatorship. The other countries were grateful that Soeurette was out and that Tyler was in. And so began a very prosperous era for the new U.S. Empire. The United States increased its economic and military power quickly, thanks to the hard work of Tyler Campbell. 
Tyler made the United States much stronger than it had been before.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it does not make someone a bad citizen if they dont keep up with the news. I think the news can affect someone's mental so strongly, that it is really up to that individual on whether they want to consume it or not. I would say that you do have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, but you do not need to necessarily consume news to do it. For example, if you dont know about COVID or the pandemic than you are not being responsible as a citizen. However, if you dont know that the US just recently signed a new bill than it is probably ok. As long as you are not a hermit, if it affects you, you will probably find out at one point.

I think that it is not possible to say that people are obligated to get their news from the media because it can literally make you depressed. The media can control the minds of people to a degree because they are showing you and effecting the way you think. If all you see is negative and violent news, you are going to think that you live in a violent and negative world. If you are on social media all the time and seeing other peoples lavish lives and highlight reels, you are most likely not going to be grateful for what you have. If you are listening to music that is talking about treating women in a certain way, or woman acting a certain way, you will probably find yourself doing these actions every now and then without even thinking about it. Everything we consume effects us, and we have to mentally know that this is a fact to combat at. 

As far as engaging with current events, i think that is more for entertainment than anything else, at least globally. Some people really enjoy knowing what is going on around the world, and if you plan on helping or plan on immersing yourself in the culture or news, than that is a great reason! For me myself, i dont get much at all from global news because of lack of interest. I also am not one to travel all that often. I feel like for me to care about the place i have to have been there. I feel bad saying that but it is just true. I feel for anyone going through hardships, but in my life now i am not really in a position to help until i get to where i need to be. Everyone is different, and if you enjoy engaging with current events then engage with current events! I think like this because i can get stressed out if i think about too many things going on around me. I just focus on being the best me and giving my best effort each day. It is not that i dont care about the world or other people, it is simply that i want to be happy and want to have a calm mind. My brain is very fast and i can get anxious if i try to worry about too many things at the same time. If i am going to induldge in any type of news i make sure that it is at night when i have completed my tasks for the day. 

In conclusion, I do not feel that people have a responsibility to keep up with the news. I just think that people need to know what is going on around them, at least enough to not be putting themselves or others into harms way.",31,6,25,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.8064516129032258,0.0,0.3722304283604136

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid by anyone that wants to pay them. It's a free country.  Anyone that wants to give them money has the right to do so.   It's not like they are getting paid by the school. That would definitely be an unethical act. But if the money is from an outside source or sponsor, then it's not a problem. I think anyone that gets paid in college is lucky. They are getting paid to play a sport. They could use the money to pay for their tuition and college expenses.  They could use the money to secure housing and set up their future. I can see why some people are against college athletes getting paid. They are afraid that the college athletes will get greedy and want more money. Also, they are afraid that the college athletes will be distracted from their studies. But I think with the right guidance, the college athletes will be able to balance their studies and their sports. I think they will have a bright future and are lucky to have such an early start.

 He was surprised that the wolf would come around, given his previous attitude. The wolf knocked and the 92nd little pig didn't play the game the first 3 little pigs had played. He opened the door, careless and without fear. The wolf did not eat him. He simply asked to come inside for a few minutes. The 92nd little pig let him in, because he was a polite pig and not the kind of person that would kick someone out in the middle of a story.

The wolf sat down and the pig served refreshments. They talked about the weather and their families. They slowly got to know one another and some trust had been built.

The 92nd little pig told the wolf that he didn't always have this amazing outlook on life.

He was the 92nd little pig, and his life would be different. It would look different, but could be every bit as enjoyable and as great an adventure. He was determined to make a positive impact on the world, as well.

He had started doing some volunteer work at the pig hospital, where there were many little pigs that were much worse of than himself. He explained that this had given him the perspective that he needed to break out of his depression. The wolf listened thoughtfully and reached a kind of revelation of his own.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing I learned was emotional intelligence. I did not take classes for it, I learned and practiced all day everyday while socializing and participating in group projects. Emotional intelligence is what allows you to work well in groups, to get along with people, and to succeed in a leadership position. There have been several recent studies saying that emotional intelligence is more important then IQ when hiring a new employee. They go on to build better relationships, have more resources and ultimately more influence. Which is a good thing since we need more emotionally intelligent, high status individuals, especially in government. 
Emotionally intelligent people make better leaders and co-workers. They are better able to understand other people, what motivates them and how to interact with them to get things done. They are better suited to work through differences and sort out problems. 
As I have stated above, emotional intelligence is a skill you learn in school whether you realize it or not and you then expand on that knowledge as you age and gain more life experience. Emotional intelligence continues to develop your whole life for better or worse. ",16,6,7,0,3,6,3,3,2,1,0.0,0.4375,0.1875,0.5776892430278885

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

  When they look at an animal, especially a cute one, or one they have an attachment to, they don't see the animal as having brought the harm onto itself, while humans are guilty of many sins.   I also think that people care more about animals because they are more vulnerable than humans.

Humans have much more capacity to anticipate pain, to fear the future, and suffer emotionally, in both the short and long term.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. Quite frankly, it's a little unsettling! This is because Mana causes people to change into monsters. 
The story follows the adventures of a young man named Takuma who has been transformed into a monster.
 He has been given the ability to transform back into his human form for a short time, but only if he can consume enough Mana to do so. He is joined by a young woman named Elvy who has the same condition. It's unfortunate because becoming a monster is really the only defense that humans have against the hostile aliens. Yet at the same time, it's a curse because it makes them look like monsters to their fellow humans. Of course, no human wants to look like a monster. Monsters are ugly and scary, and they're not very popular. So Takuma and Elvy really have their work cut out for them. They need to find Mana, but they also need to find a way to hide their condition from the other humans. They don't want to be seen, because if other humans see monsters among them, it will cause a panic. So Takuma and Elvy must be very careful. They try to stay hidden, but they also need to find Mana. If they don't, they'll never be able to return to their human forms.

Because of his troublemaker status, he's been kicked out of his home, and he's on the run. Shion is a little bit of a rebel, and he's not very good at following orders. This makes Takuma and Elvy very nervous. In order to survive, they need to stick together, but Shion doesn't seem to understand this. Shion repeatedly tries to leave the group, and he's always getting into trouble. Takuma finally has enough, and he decides to teach Shion a lesson. He tells Shion that he needs to be the one to get the Mana. Takuma says that if Shion can't do it, then he should just leave. Shion is shocked that Takuma would say such a thing, but Takuma tells him that he's just being honest. Shion decides to take Takuma up on his challenge. He 's going to get the Mana, and he's going to prove that he's not a loser. Takuma is impressed by Shion's determination, and he decides to help him. Takuma and Elvy will help Shion get the Mana. 
The three of them set out on a journey to find the Mana.
 They travel to a place called the ""Mana Zone"" where the Mana is supposed to be the most concentrated. They hope to find enough Mana to transform back into humans. But they also need to be careful because the Mana Zone is also home to the hostile aliens. The aliens are very dangerous, and they will attack anyone who enters the Mana Zone. So, in the quiet of the night, Takuma, Elvy, and Shion sneak into the Mana Zone. They hope to find the Mana before the aliens find them. Shion is the one who spots the Mana first. It's a small glowing ball of light, and it's floating in the air. Shion is so excited that he tries to grab it. But the Mana is very elusive, and it keeps flying away. Takuma and Elvy try to help Shion, but they can't seem to catch it either. It's as if the Mana is playing a game with them. The Mana is very fast, and it's very tricky. Takuma and Elvy are surprised by how much trouble they're having. Finally, they manage to corner the Mana. They grab onto it, and they pull it down to the ground. Shion quickly snatches it up, and he puts it in his pocket. Takuma and Elvy are relieved. The three monsters have finally captured the Mana.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing that you can learn from school is how you respond to the experience. Everyone's perception is different and each person takes something different away from the experience. I learned personally that school wasn't for me. I excelled in certain subjects and learned that I wanted to use those skills in my life. For example, I learned that I loved writing. 
I also learned that I didn't want to go to college.
 Rather than going to college, I just decided to write in my spare time. I've used it in many different areas of my life and that has worked out for me. I think that school really is just a journey of figuring out what personally works for you. 

Some people will have the opposite experience and will learn that they have a love for learning. They want to continue to pursue learning and will go to college. For them, that is the best choice and makes them the happiest. 

There is no set thing that one student should learn in school. The basics are already covered so you will know the basics to succeed in life by the time you leave high school. What really is unique to each student is where you want to go from there. That's why students need to just spend time trying to figure out if they like structured learning or if they want to be more of free spirits and pursue things on their own. 

What really ends up mattering is if students are happy with their decision. Their experiences should guide them to finding out who they really are. People often say that college is where you find yourself, but I do not think that is correct. College is where certain people find themselves. Other people who decided not to go already know that a different path is for them and are finding themselves in an entirely different way. No one way is correct, it all just comes down to finding your own path in life. ",27,6,20,0,1,3,1,2,1,0,0.0,0.7407407407407407,0.037037037037037035,0.4502487562189055

 Conferences were called, with all of the major world powers coordinating efforts. Conflicts and disagreements were put aside and humanity, for once, worked together. Huge leaps in science and technology were made over a period of 6 months. And at the end, humanity was ready, to reclaim Matt Damon

The aliens, meanwhile, were having a great time. They had been hosting party after party on the ship, and looked forward to bringing their guest back to their home planet. There had been some minor malfunctions on the ship, after all it was experimental tech and had been built just to go fetch Matt Damon. So they were a little stuck on the fringe of the solar system until they could figure out how to fix the ship. But it was so much fun having Matt Damon on board, no one minded!
The humans, meanwhile, had been working on a plan.
 The assembled their fleet and launched it into space. They were going to get Matt Damon back, and they were going to do it in style! They had taken design hints from the alien ship, which everyone had to admit really was pretty cool looking, and made theirs even better. As they approached the alien ship they began blasting Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" across all possible communications channels. 

The aliens were confused, but they were also pretty sure that they liked it. And the humans were confused when they received the message ""That's an awesome song! Wanna join the party? By the way your ships are awesome, do you think you could help us fix ours?""

What were the aliens thinking? Fortunately one human commander decided to talk with the aliens before attacking. Turns out the aliens didn't realize they had ""kidnapped"" Matt Damon. There had just been a miscommunication; they had asked him to come, but in their own language. Matt Damon, being a super nice guy, just smiled and nodded even though he didn't understand. And so the aliens thought he was ok with coming with them, and just walked him on board and left. 
The aliens were really sorry, and they were happy to let Matt Damon go.
 After everyone had a good laugh, the humans agreed to help fix the ship, and Matt Damon volunteered to go to their planet. But later - after all he was in the middle of a very important film!",34,1,25,0,8,15,8,7,3,5,0.0,0.7352941176470589,0.23529411764705882,0.5051334702258727

""I've prepared my whole life for this,"" said Barack as he packed his bags full of his items. He was careful not to be seen by Michelle, his wife and his kids. His guard, Reggie, was nearby to ensure that he wouldn't be discovered. Nodding to Reggie as he exited his house, Barack said, ""I'll see you in a couple days.""

One day, she meets up with a new guy. This was nothing new, as she loves to meet new people and enjoys to date as many people as she can, hoping that one person will finally be the right fit for her. All of the guys seemed to look good, but they all had the same odd personality quirks. They knew things about her that she did not tell, and she began to feel like they all seemed to actually know her. 

Meeting up with the new guy, John, she is optimistic that things might be different this time around. He is good looking, and seems to be charming. He certainly had a way with words. They were going to her favorite Italian restaurant, and she was running a little behind. When she got to the restaurant, John was already seated waiting for her.

""I'm so sorry I ran late,"" she exclaimed.

""It's perfectly fine,"" said John. ""I already ordered lasagna for you, your favorite.""

Immediately, a few bells of concern rang in her head. ""How does he know that my favorite is lasagna?""

She tried to ignore this and turn it into a pleasant date, after all she was already feeling guilty for being late. As the date progressed, John kept seeming to make mention of things that he should not know about her. Just like the past few dates she has been on. She wanted to believe that they were just coincidences, but she was feeling extremely uneasy by now.

As John was getting ready to pay for their meal, she asked ""How did you know lasagna was my favorite?""

John said, ""Well, I have a confession to make. I actually am John, but I also am Chris, Mike, and Ben. The last three guys you went out with. That's me too.""
""I just have fallen so in love with you and I keep blowing it every time we go out. I am a shapeshifter, and so I just change to a different guy and give it another try. You see, I just love you so much I need to make it work one of these times. I know you probably feel uncomfortable, but I promise it is because I love you so much. 

Horrified, the woman ran out of the restaurant. Each of those guys had been creepy and made her feel uncomfortable, and to know that it is just the same guy each time made it much worse for her. She was worried, and she needed to get away from this. She decided that she cannot date anyone for a long time because she will never know if it is this same guy. 

The woman didn't go on any dates for well over a year. In fact, she quit looking for the perfect man altogether.
One day a few years later, she was at the grocery store. She was carrying quite a few products, walking up to the register to pay. She accidentally dropped the bread, and a man behind her picked it up. ""Hi, I'm Steve."" They began to talk, and Steve asked her to get coffee sometime. She agreed, and the two connected beautifully. After several years, the two got married. They had so much in common.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it's perfectly fine to care more about an animal than a stranger. I feel the same way. There's a variety of reasons for this. The first is that animals are more defenseless so we tend to feel more protective of them, more similar to a baby. Basically we're wired to protect those who can't help themselves. That's just a natural response. A stranger who may be in danger is more likely to be able to save themselves than an animal. 
Secondly, I feel that identifying with animals is easier for me personally than other people.
 Many people feel this way. Animals can't talk so there is no chance of having some beliefs that conflict with one another. Communication is simple and effective. It works great for both parties involved. 
Another reason is that the animals genuinely love us and are so grateful for our help.
 We respond to that. With humans we don't always see that unless we personally know the human and their intentions. Meanwhile you can be around an animal for moments and feel a connection to it that you wouldn't feel around a stranger. 
Most importantly, animals can be our friends and grow with us.
 We've been friends with dogs for thousands of years. That shows the bond that can grow over time between two species. We're still working on that connection with other animals such as cats, but it will get there. And that bond is not possible with a stranger. That bond would take time to develop. 

So there's nothing wrong with focusing more on animal welfare in general. Animals can not take care of themselves in many cases and need our help. Animal charities are often overlooked. It's our responsibility to take care of animals as they rely on us. There's no reason to feel bad about choosing to help animals over a person. At least the human has a chance to so something about their situation. The animal does not. ",35,7,23,0,5,5,5,0,0,5,0.0,0.6571428571428571,0.14285714285714285,0.48552338530066813

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has had a positive affect on romantic relationships.  Technology allows us to communicate with our significant other no matter where we are in the world. Inventions such as FaceTime allow for long distance relationships to not feel so distant.

Technology has also given us dating apps and websites such as Tinder and Bumble where many people have met their boyfriend, girlfriend, wife or husband. These apps help take the stress and anxiety away from meeting someone for the first time. You can ease into a ""relationship"" by talking online with someone first. 

This allows you to get to know someone and get information on whether you are most likely compatible with them or not. 

Technology has personally helped me when it comes to dating. I have used Tinder a couple of times and actually found my current girlfriend on there. I feel like it's a very easy way to break the ice and let someone know that you're interested in them. All you have to do is swipe right and they know you're at least interesting in speaking to them.

To me, technology takes a lot of the nerves away from dating. I have been on first dates before where I was very nervous and a lot of that is because I didn't really know the other person. I was going to have to do everything in person which can be a bit hard. You don't want to say the wrong thing as that can tank the entire date.

Technology allows us to text, call, send pictures, use dating apps, use FaceTime, Zoom, etc. There are so many dating benefits that come with it. 

I also think a hidden benefit of technology when it comes to dating is the ability of taking a picture or a video. This may not come across as a benefit to everyone but catching someone cheating via picture or video is evidence that can't be argued against.

So while a relationship may end because of that and it will hurt one party badly, I still think it's a benefit. Who wants to date someone that isn't being faithful? I know people who have been in relationships in the past who suspect something is going on but don't want to believe it. When there is hard evidence, there is nothing the other person can do. So technology not only helps establish positive relationships, it also can end negative ones where one party is being taken advantage of.

Technology has helped the dating scene and continues to help relationships on a daily basis.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. Unfortunately for the aliens, humans are the only ones who can wield it. And Mana is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's one of the most effective ways to get rid of aliens, because it can be used to create weapons that are capable of destroying them. 

The aliens are fearful once they realize that humans are getting their Mana back. Mana is the only thing that can destroy them. Aliens are very resistant and resilient creatures, meaning they can survive floods, fire, and even nuclear war. But the one thing they cannot survive, not even a little bit, is Mana.

A woman named Mana Tatsumiya is the first person to be discovered to have regained her powers. Her parents named her Mana because they believe she has the power to save the world. They believe she will be the one to use Mana for the good of humankind. And apparently her parents were right about that, because Mana is the one who ends up defeating the aliens. When Mana is sixteen years old, she gets a job as a waitress at a restaurant called the Little Shrimp. The Little Shrimp is a popular restaurant, and it is owned by a man named Kyoji. Kyoji is a very kind and generous man, and he is also a very good friend of Mana's parents. One day, the aliens attack the Little Shrimp. They take Kyoji hostage, and they also hold all of Kyoji's inventory hostage. This means that customers cannot get any food or drinks from the Little Shrimp. Really, it's a sad story for all involved, especially because the Little Shrimp serves such delicious food, which includes the best shrimp in the world.

But Mana is determined to save the Little Shrimp and is even more determined to save Kyoji. She discovers that she has Mana, because while looking for Kyoji she realizes that her body is glowing. She is glowing because she has Mana. And with her Mana, she discovers that she can use it to create a sword. She uses her sword to defeat the aliens, and she also uses it to free Kyoji.

Kyoji is incredibly grateful to Mana. He is so grateful, in fact, that he offers to let her work at the Little Shrimp and get free meals whenever she wants them. Mana is very happy to accept this offer, because she loves the Little Shrimp's food. But she also loves the Little Shrimp's atmosphere. The Little Shrimp is a very happy place, and it's a place where everyone is welcome. It's a place where people can go to have fun, and it's a place where people can go to relax. Mana is very happy to work at the Little Shrimp, and she is also very happy to be a part of the Little Shrimp's family. 

So that's the story of how Mana ended up defeating the aliens. And in the process of doing so, she also ended up saving the Little Shrimp. Of course, this meant she also saved humankind from the aliens, because once the aliens who had kidnapped Kyoji were destroyed, word spread quickly among the other aliens of the threat humans posed. And from then on, the aliens were very wary of humans. They did not want to be destroyed in a similar manner because they knew that humans had Mana.

So that's the story of Mana Tatsumiya. She became a hero, and she saved the world. It's kind of interesting how such a young girl was able to accomplish all that, and from such humble means too. Who would have thought that a young girl who started as a waitress at the Little Shrimp would go on to save the world? But that's the kind of thing that happens when you have Mana.

He is the star of the Bourne series, the star of the Ocean's series, and the star of many other movies. The aliens mistaking him for being the leader of mankind kidnapped him in order to weaken the military might of planet Earth, so they could conquer it much more easily. 
The aliens did not know that the military might of planet Earth is not based on the strength of one man, but on the strength of tall the many countries and people that live on the planet. That is why, upon Matt Damon's kidnapping, all the true leaders of the world met up to discuss what to do about the aliens planning to conquer the planet. 

One of the Earth's leaders suggested an all out attack, while others chimed in that such an endeavor would likely fail if the aliens possessed superior technology. Others suggested more diplomatic options, wishing to converse with the alien leaders on finding a common ground or compromise. 
The final option was to send a single man to infiltrate the alien base, and rescue Matt Damon.
 That sole man would not only rescue Matt Damon, but also set charges and explosives to destroy the alien base upon Matt Damon's rescue. 
The leaders of Earth agreed upon the final option, and sent the man to infiltrate the alien base.
 He was a secret, not officially registered as an agent of any country of the world. Trained since his youth to be the best stealth agent, he was supposedly a ghost in the field, not being heard or seen by enemy combatants. 
Beyond his skill, te man was given a special suit, that would allow him to blend in with his surroundings.
 This made his mission all to easy, as the aliens were found to not physically possess good eyesight or others senses to detect him. The stealth agent made his way through the base, eventually coming across Matt Damon.

""Oh thank god, someone's here to rescue me, replied Matt Damon. The man quietly nodded in response, and broke the lock to Damon's cell. Once freed, Matt Damon exited his cell and waited patiently for the man to discuss their next plan. 
""We need to get out of here, and blow up the base, the man whispered to Matt Damon.


Matt Damon was surprised, but agreed. They both went to the part of the base where all the munitions and space ships were located. The man set charges all around, including a special charge that would detonate a massive explosion, taking out the base and anyone that were in its blast radius.

They then sneaked back to the agent's ship, and flew away without ever being detected. Once a safe distance, the agent handed over the detonator to Matt Damon, giving him the honors of blowing up the base of the aliens.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we need to just get over it. It's a new world since the pandemic hit. We no longer can go freely in the world without having to worry about our health and the health of others. We now watch movies of things we may have ordinarily done in reality only a year ago. 
What, for example, are the benefits of screens over reality?
 We miss the in person connection to other people. However, we open the door to an endless world of possibilities. By having more screen time, we're all discovering new ways to use such technology. Maybe you discovered a new online video game such as Fallout 76. You now get to go and visit West Virginia in the game and meet other players you never would have met before. That's a really fun experience you may never have had if not for the increase of using such devices.

here are also health benefits to using screen time.
 During the pandemic, alcohol use and other unhealthy habits became more popular. It was a way for people to cope with what is happening, especially during lockdown. Screen time can help to distract people from such unhealthy habits and addictions. It gives them something else to do to occupy their time. If you think of it in that way, it does have health benefits.
It helps that we have a 24 hour news cycle on television.
 That is a positive side of screen time as well. What we're watching doesn't have to be mindless. It can consist of learning about things and expanding our minds. And just seeing what is happening elsewhere in the world can help with the feelings of loneliness many of us have been feeling.

If you look at all of the benefits of screen time, they outweigh the negatives. Maybe in the future we can be worried about it. This is not the time, though.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. This power is somewhat chilling. Humans are able to create their own mana, and turn it into spells. But it comes at a price. Magic users are often abnormal, and some do not survive the experience. Those who do survive are changed in many ways, some of them not entirely beneficial. 
The world they wake up to is not the one they knew before.
 This world is one where Mana has caused all kinds of deformities and defects, and unfortunately these deformities and defects cause sufferers to experience a totally warped dimension of the world. It is generally one that they cannot understand because they are now out of touch with reality. They see things differently from the rest of society, and they are often unable to function at all during their daily lives. When they encounter the sight of something that can hurt them, or that they don't understand, they immediately have a violent reaction. 
In this third volume, the young man known as Andrei is now trying to understand his power.
 He is a very powerful user of mana, but this causes him to see the world in warped ways that he can no longer relate to. When he was first introduced, his power was so great that he could summon mana from the air. He could also cause things to move in unnatural ways. Unfortunately, he was unable to control it. He was unable to make his power do what he wanted it to do. Sometimes the power would be guided by his whims but often the power just seemed to have a total and complete mind of its own. This proved to be very dangerous for the world that Andrei lived in. It also put the lives of all of his friends in great danger. Even though he himself could not control his power, Andrei came to realize that his friends could. They could communicate with his power and make it do what they wanted it to. Interestingly, these friends seemed to have stepped into his life precisely in order to control his mana. But unfortunately for Andrei, this was just one of the drawbacks of mana. It tended to bring out the absolute worst in people. When people were confronted with his power, they could never resist the urge to manipulate it. They would use his mana to cause things to happen, even though this would often prove fatal for people around them. Andrei's friends used Andrei's mana for very dark reasons. Andrei himself wanted to stop his friends and could not understand why his friends were using his power in such evil ways, but he also could not control himself from refraining to do the same. Andrei's power had become a major threat to the world, and in many ways it was destroying his own life.

Fortunately, a little girl named Emmy was born in the world just as Andrei's friends were about to do some real damage with Andrei's mana. She is a special child, that from birth demonstrates great power. She can communicate with Andrei's power and attempt to control it. She can also read people very well, and she is able to figure out what their intentions are. She can stop his friends from doing what they want to do, but she needs Andrei's help in order to do so. She is well aware that Andrei himself cannot control his power and that he has no idea what it is capable of. But interestingly, she is able to control Andrei. She eventually gets Andrei to put a hold on his friends. And she eventually is able to turn the tide on Andrei's mana. Once she does so, she is able to control others' mana as well.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You look down and see a tiny bee in a suit and tie. You look at the bee and say ""I'm allergic to bees."" The bee looks at you and says ""I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I'm afraid I must carry out my orders."" ""You have been lied to all your life, and you aren't really allergic to bees."" You are in utter shock. Why would the people you trust lie to you about something like this? You look at the bee and say ""What do you mean I'm not allergic to bees?"" The bee looks at you and says ""You are the queen of bees, Your Majesty.""

This seems so impossible. The queen of bees? But you are a person, right. You look at the tiny figure and ask him to explain. The bee says that you were found when you were very little by a family that took you in. You had been born a bee, and were a bee when you were found. Over time, however, as the human family nursed you to health, you became more and more human. By the time you had reached 2 years of age, you were completely in human form. You had no memory of your life as a bee, and the family had no memory of ever having found you. All they seemed to know was that they were afraid of bees. Your human family convinced themselves that you were allergic, as a trick to keep you away from bees and finding out your real identity. 

 This all seems too fantastic to believe. You ask the bee what you should do. The bee says that you should return to the hive, and that you will be welcomed with open arms. ""How can I return to the hive? I am huge and a human, and I certainly wouldn't fit."" The bee tells you that as you get closer to your hive of origin you will return to your original form and become an insect once again. You aren't really sure you like this idea. For one, you have convinced yourself that bees will bring you harm. For another, you really like your human life and family. You ask the bee if you can stay the way you are. The bee says that the queen of bees can never be anything but a bee.

You are beginning to get frustrated with this whole situation. Who is this tiny creature to tell you what to do and who you have to be? A devious plan begins to form in your mind. What if this creature were to die? Then it would be like none of this situation ever occurred. You could go on living your life as a human, and no one would be the wiser. You only hesitate for a second longer, then you squish the bee. So quick and so simple.  You flip him off your shoulder and he lands on the ground. You look at him and think ""That was easy."" You start to go back to you walk, when you hear a buzzing sound. You look in the distance and see a dark cloud that appears to be getting closer to you. The buzzing gets closer and closer. You realize, too late, that the darkness is a swarm of bees. You have killed one of their leaders and they are out for revenge. The swarm closes in on you and begins to sting you everywhere.

---

In my opinion, the argument McDavis is making when he says, ""Paying students to play would ruin college sports,"" is valid and I agree. College sports are a great way for students to get an education and play a sport they love. If they were paid then it would set up an unfair system in which the schools that can pay the most will always get the best athletes. This would cause the smaller schools to have to pay more money for their athletes and they would not be able to afford it. It could even hurt the bottom line for the smaller colleges, causing an unfair situation. 
This sort of system could also ruin the culture of college sports for the fans as well. The fans love the college sports because they are not professional. It's really exciting to see these very young athletes do what they do on a non-professional level. If they were paid then it would take away from the excitement of college sports. Also, I would predict that if college players were paid, then after a while, there would be a few schools with the really great teams because they can afford them and the rest would have less great teams. It could cause a scenario where the good (paid for) teams keep getting better while the schools less able to pay for their teams, would see a continued decline in the ability of their sports teams. 
In conclusion i agree with the authors point that paying college athletes would ruin college sports. It would make it into something else completely;something that is good for neither college athletics, nor the schools themselves.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, yes, absolutely we can be called bad citizens for not keeping up with the news. That is because in a world that is becoming increasingly more connected and having less and less barriers, you are in direct relation with everything that happen, and people have a direct responsibility to know what is happening because their actions and the way they live their lives have a direct impact with the people that surrounds them. It helps prevent, for example, buying a product local or not that the company dumps it's waste directly into the community drinking water. In that example if everyone was aware, people would stop buying that company's products in turn forcing the company to change it very harmful practices. 

So yes, each of us do have some responsibility to know what is happening in the world, to know the communities we are a part of and it helps us take care of each other. Taking care of each other, and not just our own interests, is a part of being a good, kind, and responsible citizen. Not just a citizen of where we are from, but a citizen of the world and the human species.

If it were not for the news, we wouldn't know about things like global warming, or virus pandemic that could be happening around us. We wouldn't know about the social injustices that exist in other places or the natural disasters that affect us all. Therefore we would not act on these events, and that just by itself could really ourselves, and others around us. So, I think it is important that everyone keeps up with world events because we all live among each other, and have a responsibility to ourselves and others to know.

In my opinion, there's no need to pay athletes. It will just cause a lot of issues that we can avoid. Just because athletes shouldn't be paid doesn't mean that they don't deserve anything in return for playing. They bring money to the school after all. Maybe they could receive incentive in other ways. They could get free boarding. They could receive free meals. Those things are smaller but it's something that wouldn't drastically take away from the money that the college has. That money could be put to better use.
Sports will always be a large part of collegiate life.
 That's just how it is. We just have to figure out a way to realistically handle this. I am optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that improves the college experience for everyone involved. Maybe something could be set up to help with them getting recruited. That is the end goal anyway. To find a way to give them more exposure and get them recognized in a winning program.  That wouldn't cost anything. It would just require colleges to get creative and work with recruiters in inventive ways. 

I think this is less of an issue of if we should pay athletes. We shouldn't. This is more of an issue of if we should set up some sort of system that takes care of the athletes without money being involved. That should be the goal. We still want to allow the athletes to get something in return, it's just that money needs to be taken out of the equation. By doing that we can make everyone happy. That will end this debate and help to keep the integrity that colleges have in place.

How could the United States have been the only one to follow the isolation. Didnt all the other countries agree to it? Why was the plan not followed through with? 
The answer to that question lies in the fact that the United States was the only nation to have a nuclear bomb.
 The other nations were afraid that if they went into isolation, the United States would use the bomb on them. The United States, on the other hand, was afraid that if they didnt go into isolation, the other nations would use the bomb on them.  he United States, in order to prevent the other nations from using the bomb on them, decided to use the bomb on them first.
 The first nuclear bomb to have been dropped on a country that was capable of taking out the entire country. So maybe it was out of ill will and being frustrated that the other nations didnt follow along with the agreement, and just like that the first nuclear war began. 

The nuclear power of the united states was unmatched and much more powerful in comparison to the other nations. The other parts of the world planned on using those fifty years to group together and make nuclear weapons as good as those from the US. They were not able to successfully do so because of issues gathering relevant powerful ingredients. The United States, on the other hand, had no such issues. In fact, the US had a nuclear bomb created long before the isolation even began. This bomb was able to be used to destroy all of russia and one shot. The U.S. could literally wipe whatever country it wanted to out and off the globe. Once that other countries found out about the power of the US, everyone wanted to be their ally now instead.

The US no longer has the power it once had. Even third world countries now have more say than we do. In fact other countries mention sending us relief aid as if we are a poor country.
Meanwhile, Russia is on the rise.
 They've taken over as the new super power country. They've really embraced this role as they now swoop in to rescue other countries. It's an entirely different world. 
The new UN wants to establish an armed force that they want the US to be part of.
 However, they consider our armed forces to obviously now be subpar. They don't have the advanced technologies that other countries now have since they have shared technology for all of these years. We are given a role on par with something Canada would have had in the old days. 
We learn that Russia has developed a rail gun technology.
 This is something brand new that no one could have imagined previously. They offer to donate one to us as they think even third world countries deserve a little technology. We decline as the offer is quite offensive. We do however, accept an offer to share their Fighter Jets. They are highly advanced and the ones we have now are utterly useless in the face of such technology.

 It goes quite well though something seems off. After the exercise they send us on our way with the new jets. Once they arrive home they are stationed across the country so they are evenly spaced out.

In my opinion, I would not say that we are bad citizens for watching the news.

Even if it is not consumed by traditional TV methods, it is still all over social media, the internet, and even on the radio. As well as that your friends, and co-workers are a source of some form of the news because they spread it via word of mouth, and you watch them when they are talking to you for the most part. 

Even more so, since everyone consumes the news in one way or another, I do not think you can call anyone a bad citizen based on their consumption or lack there of, of current world events.
I do think that most people only keep up on the news that they themselves, or those around them, would be at all remotely interested in. For example, I do not think that a person who is not a sports fan would keep up with the news about sports. Someone who is not interested in what's going on in, let's say Italy, is going to watch the news about Italian affairs like someone from that area would.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools absolutely should provide free pads and tampons. I have experienced period poverty, and I certainly think that schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons. It is a necessity that helps women survive a natural, biological process. 
If a school can provide toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, and other products with the intent of helping students be healthy and comfortable
, they should be able to provide pad and tampons, which would help greatly with addressing period-related problems such as bleeding through clothes. I have been caught in uncomfortable positions and circumstances before due to the fact that I didn’t have enough pads and tampons with me, and it can be humiliating. This is because I've gotten my period on days when I've been wearing clothes I didn't want to ruin or clothes that weren't made from material that could be easily washed. For example, once I was wearing a borrowed dress when I got my period, and it was made out of satin. I had borrowed it from a friend, and I didn't want to ruin her dress because it meant a lot to her. During math class, I suddenly felt a warm and uncomfortable sensation under the skirt of my dress. It was my period. I was so grossed out because of the pressure of the blood, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up. When I stood up, I realized that I bled through my panties and all down the back of my legs. It gets worse. I realized that I'd left a huge red stain on the bottom of my dress after going to the bathroom. I tried to wash it off when no one was looking, but the blood completely stained the bottom of my dress. I had no idea what to do. And I was mortified because I realized that everyone in math class was probably able to see the big red stain on the back of my dress. I kept wiping my behind to try to conceal the stain, but instead, it got worse. That's because I'd only made the stain even bigger and more obvious. 

Even worse, I still didn't have any pads or tampons on me, so I was forced to walk around school all day with blood on my backside and the bottom of my dress. And the bloody spot kept getting bigger because my flow was so heavy on that day. The shame I felt was terrible, and I should never have to feel that way simply because it's so hard for me to get pads and tampons. The experience was so uncomfortable and humiliating, and I wish it hadn't happened to me. That's why I believe that schools should be required to provide pads and tampons for students. If during my horrible experience at school I'd had adequate amounts of pads and tampons, I probably could have fixed the problem quickly and discreetly. I wouldn't have needed to walk around all day with blood on my behind and the bottom of my dress. I could even tell that other students knew that I had my period, and they probably thought that I was gross and disgusting for bleeding through my clothes. And quite frankly, I couldn't even blame them if that's what they thought. If I were in their shoes, I would've thought that, too.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the best things that humans do is adapt. This, I feel, is just another step in our evolution.  e are now in a time where we have to adapt to the digital world.
 It was going to happen at some point in time. It's just that COVID-19 really sped up the process to an almost all digital screen time.
I personally think that we should embrace the digital world and use it to our advantage.
 I think we are, for the most part, also safer that way at the same time. Not to mention , we can now connect with people from all over the world much easier than we really tried to before hand. That has it's own benefits in itself. 

It allows us to better self manage our own lives as well, if we have the privilege's of being able to work from home. Examples would be , being able to take care of our children, or even just being able to work from home and not have to worry about the commute, and less stress and pressure from the work place.

We had already started to go in this direction of a lot of screen time, except nobody really thought about it. It was just a natural progression of the digital age. Like I said before though, it helps to keep us safe from the harsh realities of things like pandemics. 

I think people should embrace this next step in our evolution, instead of condemning it, because it was already starting to happen. Almost everyone carried around a screen (smartphone) in their pockets that they always were looking at anyways on the outside. So what is the difference if we are using it inside our homes more often. 
We are already in a time where we are more connected to each other than ever before.
  It's just more apparent now. I do not see anything wrong with it, because we can still connect to other people, family, and friends. We can still have a social life, and we can still be productive.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, there is no line that can be drawn that can tell me or anyone else that something is too dangerous. We all get to decide that.

I think extreme mountain climbing is very dangerous and I know tons of people die each year trying to climb Mount Everest. That sport would be way too extreme and dangerous for me. I'd draw the line there. But even with that information being public, there are still tons of people that go to hike that Mountain each year. 

I also wouldn't go snowboarding or skiing. Those are less dangerous and exteme sports but I have no interest in risking breaking a bone or getting severely hurt. 

The great thing about our life is that we get to make our own choices and our own decisions. We get that freedom and we also have to deal with the consequences that come from those decisions.

There's nothing that can really happen other than a severe death rate that would make me consider something too extreme for the public. I mean there are people who climb up buildings just for fun. There are people who jump out of planes. There are a lot of adrenaline junkies in our world. I am whatever the opposite of that is. I love to be relaxed, boots on the ground and as safe as can be. 

When you break it down, all sports have some danger in them. You can get hit with a baseball or a hockey puck. You can have a bad landing in basketball. You can get concussed in football by tackling someone. Everyone knows those risks. There is danger to basically everything in life when you think about it. Danger is also a thing that is defined differently by everyone. I may find something dangerous that many others don't and vice versa. 

When it comes down to it, we all make our own definitions of the words danger and extreme. We all get to choose what is too dangerous and extreme for us personally, but we can't tell others how to live their life. ",30,5,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.0,0.4965034965034965

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is such a shallow thing when you try to say ""we should care for everyone in this planet,"" or something like, ""we should care for everyone equally."" which is in the surface, probably sound very good intentioned and probably the correct mentality to have, but unless a person has the capability to treat every single one of the 7 billion people here in the planet today, it's all just a big lie.

In reality, you as a person care more for people and animals that you know rather than someone from a different country or a different continent. You care more for your family, friends, and people you know than a stranger. You're not going to pick a random stranger to sleep with you on a hotel room against your own family, right? That's going to be the same reason how you will care more for the welfare of an animal you know and love, rather than someone else that you don't know in the world.

It's very easy to say ""I care for everyone equally,"" but in reality, it's not. Billionaires who have the capability to help everyone in the world, they will care more for their own family, friends, and people they know than a random stranger. So if billionaires are unable to help the humans that are already suffering, what more for a person like you, who is just a normal person? What's easier, to feed, to groom, and to play with your dog, or to make sure someone in Africa is needing their basic necessity? I know it's a hard question to answer, but that's the reality. Even if you have spent a lot of time to help someone in Africa, there's still someone, somewhere who is suffering and you will not have the capability to change that.
So, in my opinion, it's not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.
 We are normal people. We should be focusing on the billionaires and the people who have the capability to help everyone in the world, rather than a normal person like you and me. It's not a question about morality and ethics, but it's a question about capability. It's not about trying to get rid of responsibility for your own kind, but it is to focus on the people who can do something about it. So I hope, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other billionaires will be able to help everyone in the world. Because collectively, they have the capability to do so.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is selfish to pursue extreme sports. The danger and risk involved should be apparent to anyone, even those who think it is a fun ""adventure."" Do people take into consideration the feeling of those other people who love them, if something terrible happens? No, they really don't. They are only really thinking about themselves and their own pleasure, to which they are entitled by the way, but that doesn't seem the right attitude in the presence of thrills like a high risk of death for example.

People could argue that all sports are dangerous in way. The thing is, yes that's true, but most normal non-extreme sports have an incredibly low risk of causing death. In the event of mountain climbing, you are not only risking your own life, but the lives of the people who you go with because often they are tethered to you with a rope. So not only are you going to affect the lives of the ones that love you, but also the lives of the ones that love them.  That seems pretty selfish to me. Just my opinion on it.
In my opinion, if the own government discourages the sport that you are pursuing because it is too dangerous, then maybe you should listen to
 them sometimes. They do discourage extreme sports also. There was a news story on it, many of them as a matter of fact. Also often with the surviving members of their families. Watching them being emotionally distraught is a hard thing to watch. Even more so if they are the children of the people that died from doing extreme sports. So, I stand by what I say, it is selfish.

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is a rational, common-sense, empirical one, aiming to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level. This will balance the desire for personal liberty, with the need to protect the safety of the participants.",25,5,2,1,17,29,21,8,0,21,0.04,0.08,0.72,0.45634920634920634

One day, a woman has a weird dream about her ex-husband. It was one of those dreams were you are in a place that you know, but it doesn't look anything like how it really looks. But you know it is that place anyway? And where you are with someone, but it doesn't look anything like them, but you still know it is them. It was a weird, short dream, and she woke up feeling like he was trying to tell her something. And that he looked familiar.

""Well, of course he looked familiar - even though he didn't look like Jake that's who I thought it was, so, wait, that doesn't entirely make sense, but whatever, "" she thought ""I really need more sleep, a vacation, and a new relationship, in any order.""

Maggie had split up with her ex over a year ago now, and while she had been on a few dates since then nothing had really clicked. She felt like Jake was still lurking around, like he had never left. Which didn't make any sense, as he hadn't contacted her once since the divorce was final. Which was itself weird, given how much he had fought the divorce and how hard he had tried to get her to give him a second chance. 
But that was all in the past - Maggie had moved on and was looking forward to a new, better life.
 Halfway through her drive to work, she realized who the guy in her dream had actually looked like - it was a grown up version of her high school boyfriend. ""Well, that's still weird, but at least it makes a little sense. Matt and Jake were quite a bit alike in personality if not looks.""

During her lunch break Maggie chatted with her best friend at work, Rachel. She told her all about the dream, and the two guys, and how weird it made her feel. ""Sounds to me like your brain telling you to hurry up and find a new guy! "" Rachel had laughed, ""I have a new guy friend I'm dying to introduce you to."" As a matter of fact, how about we all get together after work for a drink?""
Maggie arrived at the bar a little early.
 And happened to start chatting with a guy. He seemed nice enough, but she didn't want to make anything awkward for Rachel and her friend so she firmly told the man that she was meeting someone. He pushed a little, but when he heard she was meeting a guy, suddenly backed off. As he walked away she noticed a pendant under his collar that caught her attention, though she couldn't remember why. 
Maggie sat there for a moment and tried to figure out why the odd necklace was so familiar, when she saw Rachel and the man
 enter. She started to wave, but then froze. The man was wearing a sweater, slightly rumpled. But under it was a shirt, that had the exact pattern as the one the man she had just been speaking to had been wearing. And more importantly, Maggie could now clearly see that the pendant hanging from his neck was the same. And even more importantly she remembered why it was familiar. Her second boyfriend  had the same one - one he made in a metalworks class in college. 

And all of a suddenly so many connection began forming in her mind. All of the men she had ever dated, there were connection between all of them. She thought she had a type, but was it more than that?

You are a God-like figure who has the power to grant miracles to those you deem worthy.
 A person can only receive one miracle in their lifetime, so you must choose carefully who will have the ultimate reward. There is not only pressure on the person receiving the miracle, but there is also pressure on you. 

Giving miracles is a huge responsibility. What happens if you give a miracle to someone who does not deserve it? Or what happens if you give the wrong miracle to the right person? These pressures can be a lot for one person to handle. But you have been chosen to give these miracles to people. You are helping them experience a reincarnation of their own. 
Through your decisions, you will be shaping their lives and the lives of everyone they come in contact with.
 They will be grateful for the miracle and will give it back to you by continuing to spread the gift in their own lives. Over time, you will see the effect of these miracles. Some of the effects will be good. Some of the effects will be bad.

Although you are giving miracles away, you are giving them to humans. Humans are not perfect beings. They have flaws. They can be selfish. They can be very self-serving. They can be very greedy. But they also can be helpful. They can be kind. They can be loving.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it  Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because in general humans have more agency than animals. They certainly have more rights. But as for animal rights, they barely exist, if at all, in most countries of the world.

The history of civilization is the history of expanding the universe of rights-bearing sentient beings. For a while, slaves did not have rights, then women had no rights, and now it is time to realize that animals should have rights as well. There is no qualitative difference between the suffering of an animal or that of a human. We have a moral duty to treat sentient beings with respect and to reduce their suffering. This is not a proposition to be argued for, rather, it is a moral imperative which is axiomatic.

How can we work to reduce animal suffering? We can insist that farm animals be treated humanely, or else become vegetarian. We can also work to reduce the suffering of wild animals by supporting animal preserves and parks where animals are free to roam. We can also work to reduce the suffering of animals in laboratories by supporting animal rights groups who work to improve the conditions of animals in laboratories.

We  can also be kind to animals in our daily lives. We can stop kicking dogs, we can stop torturing cats, we can stop using animals for sport or entertainment. We can stop eating meat, we can stop wearing fur, we can stop using animals for scientific research.  We can feed wild animals in times of extreme weather, and drive with care near animal crossings.

There are already ample organization to support human rights and needs. And that is good. But to draw a contrast between helping suffering animals versus humans is a false dichotomy. We can help both. And we should.",26,6,14,2,4,21,6,15,3,3,0.07692307692307693,0.5384615384615384,0.23076923076923078,0.49754901960784315

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, there are benefits to listening compared to reading when it comes to books. The first one that pops into my head is the ability to listen to a book while I'm on the go. When I am driving to work I can put an audiobook on and get the information that way. Obviously when I am driving I have to focus on the road and therefore wouldn't be able to read a physical book on my commute.

I also love that audiobooks don't take up any physical space. A book shelf can get packed very quickly and then decisions have to be made. I don't really like to throw books out because I like them for decoration purposes. With an audiobook, I simply have it stored on an app that I can only using my laptop or my cell phone. I also can access these no matter where I am. As people we always have our cell phones on us. I find it much harder to carry a book around. 

The advantages that I think come with an actual book is the ability to read at your own pace. Some audiobooks the speed is too high or too low no matter how much you change the speed settings. When I read a physical book, I can read at my own pace. 

I also enjoy looking at the pictures in a book that are specifically found in biographies. Since an audiobook is just audio, you can't see the pictures. 

I prefer to use audiobooks just because of the convenience of them. I love having the ability to lay in my bed before I go to sleep and listen to a chapter. It helps relax me. 

I also want to make it clear that I love reading physical books as well. Both methods give a unique experience to the reader and I don't think either method is going to go away anytime soon. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and situation.

Whether you read a physical book or you listen to an audiobook, reading is a great way to exercise our mind. I love it.

In my opinion, I actually think yes, we are being bad citizens if we ignore the news. I think everyone has some responsibility to know what is happening. Mainly, I think it's important to have an awareness about what is going on because it gives you a platform for making a difference and taking action. Keeping your head in the sand and not knowing the issues that are going on in the world or in your own community doesn't help anyone and it's sort of dangerous to not have a view of your own.

There will come a day when we all need take action. 9/11, for example , ended up being a turning point for the United States. Many people were in the dark leading up to that event, but once it happened, everyone was forced to be aware of what was going on and take action. If something that monumental were to happen today, people wouldn't know where to go and how to voice their opinions if they hadn't been keeping up with current events. The worst thing would be to have no clue how to go about acting because you never really knew the issues in the first place.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---
I do not believe people ought to be worried about the amount of screen use that people engage with during the pandemic. he reason for this is that the amount of screen time that people engage with during the pandemic is not ggecessarily going t be seeflective of the amount of screen use that will be present after the pandemic has ended. In fact, I believe many will decrease their screen use after the pandemic, with some even going back to their pre-pandemic screen use time. he reason for this is that people will be more aware of the benefits and drawbacks of screen use after the pandemic.
 As a result of the pandemic, many switched to screen use for their work, social interactions, and other personal interests. This was in lieu of more traditional means of dealing with such occurrences in one's life, such as working with others on site. As a result to this transition of social distancing and working from home, many will learn that they operate better outside of the home, and through seeing people face to face. Remote work and social interactions through digital devices will be seen as a way to get things done, but not as a replacement for face to face interactions for everyone. In fact, many might only rely on remote work and their increased screen use due to personal obligation, and would distance themselves from such technology once it is safe to do so. Many are not comfortable working from home, and others don't enjoy their hobbies or even watching a movie with friends unless they are in the same room. Thus, I think people should not worry that screen use is significantly higher among people due to the pandemic, as the amount of screen time people do for school, work, and connecting with others will evidently decrease when people can safely meet with each other.

With that in mind, people ought to embrace the benefits that our digital devices provide. While many will not see such devices as a perfect substitute for in person interactions, I still think people will benefit from its use and widespread implementation. Digital devices allow us to keep in touch with our friends, family, and colleagues, through means such as text messaging, email, and video chat. These are great ways for many to converse with others quickly, to share information for work or personal reasons, and to share the content that we enjoy. In addition, digital devices allow us to learn from others, through the use of online courses, videos, and other educational content, which may be difficult through more traditional means. People should not necessarily fear the technology available today, for they benefit others even if they use it less frequently than most. Many people have the means to implement digital devices in their life to gain benefits from them, and I believe that they should do so while moderating it with in person interactions.",24,6,12,1,5,8,6,2,3,3,0.041666666666666664,0.5,0.25,0.404553415061296

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I feel this way because I think staying informed is an important part of the democratic process. I can't imagine going to the polls and having only a very vague idea of what the candidates stand for or any idea what is going on in our country. In order to be able to have a solid voice in what information is conveyed and how the country is governed, I think we should all be as informed as we can. The best way to do this is by keeping up with the news. 
I find that engaging with current events actually does a lot.
 For example, climate change is a current event that is ongoing, and keeping engaged can help people learn how to mitigate that crisis and actively be part of a solution. The same goes for learning about the ongoing conflicts and refugee crises. There are charities that benefit from more people having knowledge of crisis because it means more people may be moved to donate. And it also means more people may be moved to take part in things like marches, or inviting representatives from organization and bringing them into their community. In this way, the news can actually help give people the drive to come together for the purpose of positive change. 

It's also good to be able to communicate with you fellow citizens about things they think about and understand. Keeping up with the news can ensure that you will always have something to talk to people about and that can make someone a more friendly and approachable citizen. 

All in all it does seem that not keeping up with the news or engaging at all with current events does stand to make someone a bad citizen. ",19,6,8,0,5,6,5,1,0,5,0.0,0.42105263157894735,0.2631578947368421,0.46153846153846156

	We can talk about how scary it is to be alone, how lonely it feels, and the gnawing fear of abandonment that we carry around. We can talk about how it hurts to be rejected and criticized, and how it feels to be ignored. We can talk about the fear of being on our own, and of having to depend on ourselves. We can talk about the anxiety that we feel when life doesn’t go as planned, and how we can fall apart when our plans are derailed.  e can talk about how we’ve tried to do everything in our power to fit in, and hyet somehow we're always on our own. Lovers leave us, friends slowly disappear from our lives either because they've moved to another state or country or perhaps they moved on with someone else. ..

We can talk about how we've always wanted to believe that there is someone special out there for us, but our dreams have been shattered by disappointment again and again. We can talk about how we hoped to have friends that would last a lifetime, friends who would be there for us no matter what. But life and situations change as do people and relationships, and nothing ever lasts forever. Our best friends and close family members can be the ones that hurt us the most. The very people that we would do anything for, but sadly leave us in the end...

But to our credit, we find a way to somehow continue to live and survive in this world. It rarely easy or without pain or struggle, but somehow we make it from one day to the next. We always hope that tomorrow will bring a better day even if it rarely does. We find things to do to keep our minds occupied and to distract from the pain of loneliness that slowly eats away at us from within. For some of us, the struggle continues every day, but some find their way in time you just have to keep at it. Find people that share and enjoy your hobbies and passions, and never give up hope that tomorrow could be the day that changes your life in a better way forever. Maybe not all of us will find soul mates, but never let the dream die and the hope shall remain eternal.

In my opinion, people should not be pressured to keep up with the news, nor should they be made to feel inadequate if the don't do so. Ours is not a society like that of ancient Sparta where every male citizen filled the same role, that of soldier. People in our society fill many different roles and take a multitude of different paths in life. 
I think it is a good thing that people are not forced to be informed about the news.
 Some people simply don't have the interest or temperament for news. Should we dictate to every artist and poet that they must be more informed of worldly affairs? Many people make great contributions to society without having any interest in the news at all.   think that people should be free to choose what they want to know about.
 This type of freedom is pivotal to our way of life. We must remember that it is not only freedom of action that we should espouse but, crucially, freedom of thought. Shaming people who don't follow current affairs is simply a form of mental tyranny. It is important for us to allow this spirit of freedom to thrive and not try to dictate the interests of everybody. Of course it's true that the news is important. But it's also true that it is not the only thing that is important. Certainly many people should take an interest in current affairs and the truth is that many are naturally inclined to do so. For those that do not have this inclination, let them go on their own path in freedom. ",22,6,13,0,3,5,3,2,2,1,0.0,0.5909090909090909,0.13636363636363635,0.49122807017543857

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, reading is always better than listening. Reading involves a ritual that you do not get with an audiobook. You sit down with a cup of coffee in a chair. You open the book and hold it in your hands. You flip pages and go at your own speed. You are fully immersed in the author's words. Nothing else is going on in the world. It's an experience that is very unique. 
With an audiobook you get none of that.
 You hear the same story but you don't get the same experience. With an audiobook, you get distracted. You often times are doing other things at the same time. You might end up missing part of the story because of that.
Reading takes time but it's so worth the time you spend to just sit there and enjoy reading.
 You won't be able to multitask but that is part of the charm. It's an old fashioned luxury you could say. I think it's important to enjoy the experience of reading. The experience of doing it, not just the actual task of hearing it like in an audio book.

While audiobooks do have their advantages, it's nice to disconnect from technology. It even comes down to physically going to the library to get a book. Rather than downloading an audiobook, it's so refreshing to visit a library. That's another experience that you miss out on otherwise. Obviously, audiobooks aren't going anywhere anytime soon but it's nice to detach from that world for awhile.

I firmly believe a physical book is better. It feels nicer and I have better interactions with an actual book. I'm all for the occasional audiobook sometimes. It gives you a chance to take in a book when you are busy. Nothing will ever beat a good old fashioned book and a cup of coffee on the weekend though.

Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids. But this only made all the long-string-of-digits dads even more riled up. There was one kind of amusing case with my sister's ex's cousin's dad, though - it turns out he wasn't even her dad! His mug went blank when he held it, and that was definitely confusing for a while until his wife came clean about the real dad. Hoo boy, I would not have wanted to be in that room when that news broke, though.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it. The police have had a much easier time convicting abusive dads for one thing, and a lot of marriage counselors are making bank. Kids are less afraid to speak out about their rights as people and parents are really listening to them. So I guess that does bring a little bit of good out of it, right?

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  We're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace,  Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction. e should focus on our own lives, and not worry about what the Kardashians are doing.

The core of McDavis'  argument is that if student athletes were paid then a ""handful of big sports programs"" would have the best athletes while all the other schools would lack the money to retain quality competitors. I disagree with him, but not because I think that statement is entirely wrong. On the contrary, I think McDavis is entirely accurate and even realistic. However, he doesn't consider the system in place now.

Are college sports egalitarian in the absence of payments to athletes? Of course not. Even under the current system, the best college athletes play for the richest schools. Successful college sports programs have the money now to actively recruit the best athletes. They send coaches in luxury jets to visit potential athletes, wave promises of future success in from of them, court their parents, lavish luxury accommodation and transportation on them, stroke their egos and introduce them to famous alumni.

In my opinion, keeping up with events in the news makes us more involved in life.  It makes us able to cope more effectively in negotiating our own life and make mature decisions. Being aware of things that are going on in politics and business for instance, helps make decisions about important investments, say, in a 401K investment, mutual funds or stocks. It can directly affect our income, retirement and children's college education. If, for instance, we don't understand what Block chain is, or silicon Valley, apps, or computer AI, then we won't know whether we should diversify our portfolios, or just buy stock in Apple. We'll still be imagining that buying stock in solely gas fired cars is the best option, not new fangled cell phones. It's silly, we need to be engaged and understand the business world, keeping up with news and tech development.

We should understand politics and government issues, in our country and the world. This has direct business applications and advantages to us and our families. If government is outlawing, for instance, gas stations, then perhaps we want to divest our stock in Gas and oil companies and look at energy companies that are developing ways to charge cars on freeways at exits. Perhaps that is a good use of money. Government can determine some of this and it can inform the way we build wealth and security. It has real applications. Simply saying news is boring, I just want to connect with friends on facebook and gossip, it's more fun - is inane, ill advised, and will cause you to suffer financial hardship.

By all means, look at different new sources, it's the way to help educate yourself, build knowledge and participate in financial matters. If anything we're responsible to our families and ourselves to be informed. We should know what laws and taxes affect us. We should, furthermore, vote for politicians who can bring about the financial advantages, say for instance, lower taxes or investment in infrastructure from the government. We should be aware of the government's actions and how they affect us. We should influence the government and also get involved, if only in voting.

Consider investing at least a few minutes every day to involving yourself in reading or watching news, make a goal and stick to it. Find out what things affect you directly and involve force upon ways to improve that outcome. It will pay off if you focus. Knowing is almost always better than ignorance. Getting answers is better than only having questions.

In my opinion, I do not find this argument persuasive. I also believe it would be fair if colleges paid their athletes because the colleges make money off these players and they could use that money to pay them fairly. These athletes play games for these colleges at risk of their own health, like concussions, broken bones, knee injuries, and other health problems consistent of playing sports, and it would be fair for those players to be paid for their hard work.

I also believe it would make other students, who are not as academically inclined, to try harder to get into college. From there they could really learn a serious life skill if they are not drafted for the pro leagues. While the players doing sports in school, at the same time, will have a chance to really excel in whatever they do. All, or most, of their motivation would come from the prospect of being able to do something in college that they love and get paid for it at the same time. All while majoring in another few subjects. 

The colleges make tons of money from these players, so I do not find the argument that they should not be paid feasible even in the slightest. Did I also mention that it would help bring more ""minorities""  into college for a chance to achieve their dreams and leave them in a better place for their life. Parents would also be proud, and more inclined to encourage their children to try to get into college at the same time.

Although it has been necessary because of the situation, I know that too much time staring at a screen can have negative effects on someone's health. For one, too much screen time can hurt a persons ability to fall asleep at night.  know that I have been having trouble falling asleep at night because of the amount of time I spend on my computer., especially if I'm working too late. And although connecting through devices can help us feel more connected, if kids are using them to play games and use them as an escape for too many extended periods, it seems like it could have the opposite effect and increase isolation over time due to less social activity. 
Another reason I think we should be concerned about excessive screen time is because it can cause eye strain. Straining our eyes for many hours a day can cause headaches and other issues. All in all I think that yes we should be concerned. Although our devices have been our lifeline during this pandemic, I think we should back off of the excessive use over time because too much of it just isn't healthy.",15,6,4,0,5,9,6,3,3,3,0.0,0.26666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.547945205479452

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are not as convenient as regular books for multiple reasons. First, to use an audiobook, you have to have speakers or headphones and that can be cumbersome to have with you at all times. I know I find it rude when someone in a waiting room or on public transportation is listening to an audiobook or something on their phone without headphones. It is like an invasion of my space. I don't want to hear what they are listening to. 
econd, you have to be able to listen to the book at a certain pace.
 I am a pretty fast reader and I can get through a book pretty fast. With an audiobook, I have to listen to the words only as fast as the speaker is dictating them. Also, I can go back and re-read a page or passage much easier in a regular book than I can with an audiobook. I have to rewind and hope I stop at the right point. It's frustrating. Third, I don't like the way audiobooks sound.
 With an audiobook, you have to hope you like the sound of the narrators voice. If you do, you are in good shape, if not, it can make for a long and arduous listen. It also is harder, for me at least, to get a good mental image of the scene while listening to an audiobook. I can see it in my head much easier when I read. 
Finally, I can't lend an audiobook to a friend or family member as easily as a physical book. I have to lend them my phone or tablet, and I don't want to do that. With a physical book. I can just hand them the book and they can give it back when they are done. It gives me the pleasure of knowing I have shared something that I enjoy with someone hoping that they will enjoy it as well. 
I am not saying that there are no advantages to audiobooks, but more why I greatly prefer physical books over an audiobook any day.",28,7,17,0,4,5,4,1,1,3,0.0,0.6071428571428571,0.14285714285714285,0.4314214463840399

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the screen usage of a typical human have significantly increased over the years, and I do not want to be hypocritical, but right now, I think I'd rather read a book than a newspaper or watch TV. My dependence for screens is very much like a drug. I do not know what do with myself one day when my computer broke and I needed to purchase a part and it has not arrived yet. I was going crazy.

There was more to life than checking my e-mail every few minutes or browsing the Web for background information to support a presentation. Sure, having access to phones and computers all the time has its benefits. For one, there are plenty of ways this digital age allows us to communicate with people across the globe, and there are also lots of ways we are able to educate people without the need for one on one contact, specially during the time of the pandemic, when it is mandatory to keep distance from other people.

But it's definitely ruining my life. The same way how drugs overused can ruin someone's life when they're addicted to it, overly involved in computer, video games or other applications is the same. There was nothing interesting to do in my house, nor in my neighborhood, or anywhere in the town, and I became totally dependent for my entertainment. I did not want to communicate with people, because there was nothing to talk about and I was tired of it. My social intelligence and how I connect with people have become a bit damaged, only because I was left alone with this computer and now, I never know what to do with myself when I'm out in the open. It's very scary.

So yeah, while I do not want humanity to go back to the Dark Ages, when there were no electrical devices invented, I do not think it will be a good idea for humanity to go through another Dark Age. And there's no denying that having all the humanities' knowledge and information at your finger tips is not a bad thing. But at the same time, aspects that you normally do not consider that's being damaged like social intelligence and the ability to remember things, are negatively impacted. Our reliance to technology has to be limited at one point, not just because it is a good practice to do if you want to keep your life on track.

As for me, I will try my best to contact more people I know and if we can return to normal, possibly even go to the town once again. Find more people to communicate with, and try to carefully pick and choose what technology, video games, programs or apps I decide to use. Screen use will not go away any time soon, but we shouldn't be too dependent on them to the point it hurts our abilities to connect with other people.

Why are they all waiting for your command? You look down at your arm and see a small bee stinger sticking out of your skin. You look down and are shocked. You were obviously stung but didn't have an allergic reaction.

You think to yourself, ""what is going on?"" The bee who called you Your Majesty ended up stinging you. He was marking you to be the Leader of the bee army. You talk to that bee and ask him why he stung you. The bee tells you they need a leader that has access to a GPS.

The bee tells you that there is a garden that the bees need to get to in order to save their friends but they have no way of finding the place. They only know the name of the place and can't use a GPS since they're not human. They also can't talk to anyone that isn't the King of the bee army.

You ask the bee what the name of the Garden is. He tells you that the name is The Honeycomb Garden. You put that into the GPS and to your surprise, a location pops up. It's about a 30 minute walk from your current location.

You tell the bee that and that bee communicates it with the rest of the army. You start walking towards the location. You get close enough to see a sign that says The Honeycomb Garden but you have to cross a bridge to get there.

To your surprise there is a troll protecting the bridge and tells you that a riddle must be solved in order for you to cross. The troll asks you the riddle which is what has to be broken before you can use it? You think quickly and turn around to the bees who are all looking on nervously. You give them a thumbs up and tell the troll your answer is an egg. The troll gives you the thumbs up and lets you walk across the bridge. You walk across the bridge and the bees are able to get to Honeycomb Island.

You turn around quickly and all of a sudden you see a group of bees fly right by your head.

""What the Hell?"" asked the president.
The story follows the adventures of the United States in their quest to find out what happened to the rest of the world.
 Nobody knows what's going on. Nobody outside the United States knows what's been going on inside of the country. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. As the United States begins to realize how isolated it has become, the people panic. Everyone assumes the worst. The people within the US have been living without any input from the rest of the world, so they are already in turmoil. Once they realize that the rest of the world intentionally cut them off, conspiracy theories begin to take hold of the population. The US government is in a state of chaos.

Voting rights have been stripped away to the point that the US has had only two leaders over the past 50 years. The president who was in charge at the end of the war served until he died. After his death, it was found that, in his will, he had left the country to his son. He had done so, after making his son the secretary of defense. His son now held the military power of the US, as well as the presidency. The son was a ruthless dictator.

He had, for many years, rounded up members of the opposing political party and executed them. He became so extreme that he could no longer be seen as a member of any political party. That's when he started rounding up entire cities, towns and villages. They were mostly executed, but many people were in massive prisons that he had commissioned, early in his rule. He had the power to do whatever he wanted, and he did.

When the people of the United States realized that the rest of the world was suddenly aware of what was going on in their county, they decided to make a gamble that some nation, or group of nations, would help them if they started a civil war to regain power to the people. The people of the United States were desperate. They began to organize street protests, to see how far they could push the leader before he would start military action in the streets. The leader responded by sending in the military to break up the protests.

Many people were killed. The chaos played out on the world stage. The rest of the world was horrified. The people of the United States were wrong. The rest of the world did not come to their aid.

You shake your head.

You hold up your hand in a stop motion and shake your head. ""No, no please. The short version. I can't believe I've been left alone this long anyway - everyone is so protective of me I am hardly ever alone.""
""Very well, your Majesty."" said the bee.
 ""The short version is a human witch had a grudge against the bee kingdom. And, in her anger turned out Prince into a human. The baby Prince was then brought to a human family who could not have children, in exchange for protecting the witch from her enemies. And a lot of money. Sire, that Bee Prince was you.""
You stare at the bee for a moment, then start to laugh.
 ""You're telling me my parents are mot my parents, that I was stolen, and that I AM A BEE?!""

After it’s done you are taken forward to live your next life. That can be a bit scary and even sad for some of us.

Not everyone wants to be reincarnated. Not everyone wants to come back to this Earth. But reincarnation allows us to experience many different lives. It allows us to experience all the different roles we can play. It allows us to be a parent, to be a child, to be an animal or plant. Anything is possible with reincarnation.
Some people believe that reincarnation is like going from one room into another, and then you decide if you want to go back to the original
. We also get to choose our next life, including the place where we will live and who we will be. Those people believe that we have some control over our life. Others believe that we are reincarnated into something or someone by random chance. Whatever your belief is, reincarnation allows us to experience the many different roles we can play.
What is it like to be a ghost?
 
To be a ghost is to be in purgatory.
 But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. 

We are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. 

Some humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be. It is a place where there is no pain, suffering, or any other negative experience. It is a place where we can live forever with the people who are most important to us. That is peaceful to most humans. Why die if we can live forever?

Humans have beliefs and ultimately the end of life is unknown. When you look around and look into science there are many conflicting beliefs. The world has so many different religions, and humans have a hard time to putting their faith into one set of beliefs. Ultimately you choose what you want to believe in. We will all experience death one day, and in my belief our physical bodies will be thrown away like a jacket. Our spirit will rise out of our body and ascend to heaven. We will meet our maker and live a life of eternal bliss with those who were closest to us. Life is beautiful.

In my opinion, we should get over it and embrace the benefits of technological communication, work. and learning. The pandemic has made me acutely aware of how contagious all of us are. Every year a flu virus runs rampant in society because people do not socially distant themselves or use sanitary behaviors to prevent the spread of sickness. We need to be able to write our own story and engage face to face in accord with our own individual preferences.

What would it look like, to have people choose how to work and play? Everyone will have the freedom to engage in the way they want and believe it is best for them.  Technology allows people to work and learn and commuincate digitally if they so decide so there is no reason to stop anyone from opting out of in-person presence. People will be happier. People will adapt to the now flexibility. 

Personally, I would use caution when in person. I would want to still spend time with my family and a few friends. And I would love to just work from home and have delivered any items I need.  I do not need the gym, the library, the coffee shop, the workplace, the classroom, or the retail establishments. I did/do not miss them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology makes for an extremely impersonal way of dating. What happened to the good old days when young people went out on a date and actually talked with each other? Now the dating process is reduced to texting and using social media. I remember that when I was young, young people had to meet each other, talk to each other and find something in common before they could know whether they were compatible. And that led to a lot of fun nights out and a lot of wonderful, unexpected experiences. For example, I know I loved heading to the local pizza joint and talking and dancing with girls to records and jukeboxes. And I really loved taking the girls to baseball games (and it didn't hurt, in retrospect, that I was a really good third baseman back in my high school years). It was also always fun to cut through Central Park just before sundown, or to head into the Village. Those were some wonderful times, and every date felt like a new adventure, and I still think fondly about them even today.

I met my wife as a result of slipping on a patch of ice as I went out for a late-night slice of pizza at the local pizzeria. It was totally accidental, of course — I had just come from a local bar and had been carrying a drink in one hand and looking at my watch in the other.  In my defense, it was a really cold winter night. I fell and landed on my left side and was starting to get up when I saw a beautiful, tall blonde come rushing forward to help me. And I don't know if it was the cold, the drink, or the shock but I suddenly blurted out something like: ""You will make some guy very happy someday."" And then I promptly fell back down, hit my head on the icy sidewalk, and blacked out. 
When I came to she was standing there, with a thoughtful expression on her face.
 As I sat up and rubbed the back of my head, I looked at her and then looked down at the pizza slice lying next to me. And she, without missing a beat, picked up the slice and handed it to me. It was then that I knew that this woman would be somebody that I would have to meet again, just so I could take her out to dinner. I took her out for pizza next week and we hit it off immediately. That was 44 years ago, and I still think fondly about that night.

But these days, most young people don't even bother to meet their potential date, just as long as he or she looks good in a profile picture. It's like they're shopping for a new car on the Internet, only the price is something called ""the compatibility rating."" It's an impersonal and dehumanizing experience, and I don't think it does anybody any favors. After all, haven't you seen the statistics on divorce in this country? It just shouldn't surprise anyone that over half of all first marriages end in divorce, when young people don't even bother to spend time getting to know one another. Poking and swiping through selfies might work for some people, but what happens when you get off of your phone and get into the real world? Marriage isn't about finding a picture on your screen — it's about finding a person you can trust and love and spend the rest of your life with.

Let's just be real, I never would have met my wife if I had been glued to my phone all the time. I was out enjoying my life in the real world, about to eat a slice of delicious New York pizza, and I hit my head on a patch of ice. And that was all it took for me to dive right into a wonderful, loving relationship. I just don't think that Tinder or Match or JSwipe is going to produce any such results...at least, not for all of us. So in conclusion, I would have to say that I think technology in general, and the so-called ""dating apps"" specifically, are probably not helping our society in any way; the technology probably makes us more isolated, less social creatures, and more shallow as individuals. I don't know if I can make any more sense than that.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

  Do they have the right to potentially throw away God's most precious gift?

It is generally accepted that people have the right to risk their lives for excitement or thrills. But isn't it selfish to risk one's life for the sake of a sport?
The answer is yes, it is selfish.
 he reason is that the value of one's life is infinite.
 If you question this, ask a parent what they would give to get a dead child back, or a husband what he would do for even one for more day with their late wife.
TIf te value of one's life is infinite, ahhen t is selfish to risk it for anything less than an infinite value.
 And who is their right mind could argue that there is any lasting value in the thrill someone gets by showing off on a sheer mountain cliff?
The only reason that people risk their lives for the sake of a sport is because they are selfish.
 With luck, the young people taking these risks will grow up to see just how selfish they have been. Without that luck, they will leave gaping holes in the lives of those who love them, just as would happen in the aftermath of a suicide, overdose or fatal car crash.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, there are many benefits to audiobooks. Many people are on the go with limited free time. Audiobooks enable people to listen to books while working on other projects. Also, audiobooks can be especially good for students and children, who can listen on the way to/from school or while playing outside. Furthermore, some people seem to learn better via audio over sight. Listening to books can be a great way to work through reading tasks and gain a new perspective on what one has read.

However, there is something lost when listening to audiobooks. Books can be transportive, making it hard to truly immerse oneself in a book when listening instead of reading. There is a sense of progress and oneness while reading a physical book that is a bit lost when you can't literally feel the number of pages thinning as you race towards the end. There are many small lessons a book reader innately absorbs about language arts, too. Book readers--via exposure--are almost certainly better spellers, with an elevated sense of what's possible with vocabulary, sentence structure, and when to use different punctuation marks. A person also has to simultaneously conceptualize the scene in their mind and picture it in their head while reading. People do this to some extent with audiobooks, but the audio will play on even while the listener has mentally begun to daydream. Book readers have a natural advantage here, too, where if their mind begins to drift, they simply cease progressing through the story, and can pick right back up where they left off. 


So, audiobooks are not for everybody.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things that students should learn in school are writing, science, and reading. These are building blocks to a good solid education. Reading and writing are essential to effective communication and a solid understanding of grammar and syntax. And without science, we would all have no idea about why things are the way they are. Learning about science helps us understand our world and how things work.  These skills ensure our survival and reduce our dependency on new technology, thus preserving our natural intelligence.  People that can communicate their thoughts and ideas are also able to document their findings and discoveries. Without writing and science our society would not benefit from these important contributors to our society and culture. These elements are how archaeologists are able to learn about past civilizations and how researchers can learn about what we have recently discovered. I believe that this knowledge will help us further our understanding of the universe and the people around us. This is why it is important to introduce basic reading and writing and science skills as early as possible. They are key to the success and survival of our future and are part of everyday life.

It didn't matter whether it was a blind date or not, though, because they all ended up being the same.
  No matter what she said, or how she introduced herself, all of her suitors seemed to ask the same sets of questions.

""Jack Johnson"" he replied

""Do you have a twin brother, named John Jackson?""

He got nervous and sweaty at that point.

""No, I'm serious.""  I met him just last week, ""See, we took pictures together!"" and she showed him some smiling photos of herself with her one-time date who looked exactly like this new stranger.

He didn't explain himself, but she understood.  ""That's okay,"" she said, ""I had fun with you the last time you looked like this.  Why don't we try again.  Can I call you John?""

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students. It's a health issue, and schools need to be responsible for the health of the children they are charged with supervising.
Period poverty is a real issue.
 Young women need to be protected from the social stigma of poverty. eriod poverty is a health issue.
 Not having the necessary items for self care is both physically harmful and emotionally stressful. It puts an undo burden on young women to allow them to go through a day at school without what they need to take care of themselves. 

There is no opportunity for a child to better their own situation. These young people are expected to attend school, and they need all of the necessary supplies to do that in a healthy, safe and comfortable way. When the parents can't afford lunch, most school systems, who can afford it, provide lunch for the student. The same principle needs to apply to young women and girls who may need sanitary supplies, and cannot afford them. 

Resources are very limited in many school districts and I empathize with their plight, but forcing children to attend school all day without making sure they have adequate supplies is simply wrong. It shouldn't matter what gender the student is, or what the need is. If there is a need, the school needs to be accountable for making sure that the need is met. I hope that resources become easier to come by for these schools but until then, there can be no excuses made.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

The experience I had with dating were ones that did not have me using dating apps of any kind. I primarily dated potential romantic interests through in person connections and interactions, from my time in school. I also did not use dating apps, given that they weren't as prevalent as they are now, nor would I say they were as effective or helpful as they would be now. Thus, I preferred to avoid using dating apps, and instead chose to date people without finding first on a dating app. Nevertheless, dating apps, I believe, can give people otherwise more romantic opportunities than they would have otherwise through more traditional means. Dating apps are quite useful and beneficial for many to try out, especially if they struggle to discover and find people to date. Additionally, I do think that dating apps allow for people to more easily meet potential romantic interests for long-term relationships, allowing them to date with less complexity than otherwise. For that reason, I believe dating apps will persist long into the future, being well implemented in how others date as well as other technology that is being refined and improved upon as well.

Like dating apps, technology like Netflix, social media and texting also enables people to connect with each other regarding romantic encounters, especially in the instances where that may be difficult. For dating and romantic relationships, being able to communicate and talk your partner is critical in maintaining trust and a romantic connection, which leads way for a solid relationship or a long-term partnership. Even for short-term relationships, communication via text and social media can improve how positive you view the interactions you have with others. The technology available today has many good benefits to it, in the sense that it allows for us to make connections with others easier and faster, something that can be seen how ubitquitous it is in romantic and non-romantic relationships. Although there are some negatives associated with technology use, specifically when people fail to moderate and balance it well with other aspects of their lives, I believe many would be able to learn and implement how to best use technology in their life. If anything, as time goes on, the technology people use for romantic interactions and dating will get more and more refined, ensuring more positive and favorable outcomes for the user, and potentially ensuring more relationships are made and sustained.",22,9,7,0,6,9,6,3,2,4,0.0,0.3181818181818182,0.2727272727272727,0.4700854700854701

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid directly by the school. Like the author said, it will make unfair competitions between schools who will get caught up in a bidding war for a student. This can dishearten other student athletes not only in other sports, but even on the same team, knowing they cost so much less. 

I do think that student athletes should be paid in scholarships, because it's the only way for them to go to college. I think this is good enough of compensation for the athlete because they would not be able to even play if they were not going to school. School should also be their top priority, even though it often is not. 

A lot of people argue that there is a ton of money in college sports that make people rich while the student see nothing, which is true, so I think the profits from the student athletes should be reinvested back into the school and not line people's pockets. This will make the athletes feel like they are making a difference which may make them want to perform better. 

If you pay a college athlete directly it may influence them to slack off in their normal schoolwork since they will view that part of the college experience as lesser to them since they are making so much money playing sports. Not paying them will help them keep a balance.  Paying them might make them so focused on their sport that they may disregard the importance of good grades.
BI think a scholarship is adequate because it'll give the chance at a college education to some people who may not have had that chance to begin with whether it be due to their grades or their financial situation at home. 

Its also not necessary to pay the athletes because most of the ones that would get paid and are big money makers for the school, will probably end up being a pro and get paid once they graduate. They can look at their college ""career"" as training for their pro career. 
College athletes don't need to be paid, it's not part of the job description, they are already receiving a free college education. which I think is more than fair for them.  ",25,9,12,0,4,5,4,1,4,0,0.0,0.48,0.16,0.4570383912248629

The film was shot in and around San Francisco and Los Angeles.
 It's directed by Michael Oates Palmer, who also directed ""Unforgettable"" in 2006. 
The film was released on DVD through New Video in February 2008.
 he film won a Best Feature Film Award at the 2007 Accolade Film Festival.
 Needless to say, it's a very popular film among young people in particular, and has also made quite a name for itself among fans of indie movies. If you've ever seen this movie, you may know why.

Basically, the film follows the story of a woman who is struggling with the fact that every guy she's been dating has been cheating on her. Her name is Soeurette and she is constantly finding this guy named Matt to date and to marry. Soeurette is too stupid to realize that Matt is actually the same person. In fact, he doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's the same person. He literally uses the same name, has the same phone number, and makes no changes to his appearance. But every time Soeurette boots Matt out of her life for cheating, she tries her best to forget him, erases him from her contacts, and blocks him from her social media. And as a result, she actually succeeds in forgetting him. Then, he comes back again in the same form, just like how it always happens. She then falls in love all over again. It's a very interesting concept for a film.

This time, though, Matt wants to make things right. Of course, isn't that what he always says? He wants to finally settle down with Soeurette and give her the life she's been dreaming of. He decides that he's going to delete his Tinder profile, since that was always the source of his problems with Soeurette. It was always too tempting to see so many blondes on Tinder. And now, with his Tinder profile deleted, he has nothing to distract him. He'll be able to focus all his attention on Soeurette. Unfortunately, a friend of Soeurette's tips her off that Matt has actually been the same boyfriend who's cheated on her the last 10 times. Soeurette is so confused as to how she could have been so stupid as to think that this was a different guy each time. Honestly, it's a little concerning that she could have been so naive to believe that a different man would have the same name, phone number, and social media profile as he does. It also makes you wonder what kind of life she's been living. 
But what really pushes Soeurette over the edge is she finds out that Matt has been cheating on her with another one of
 her girlfriends, named Christelle. Soeurette is so angry, but she's also upset at herself for failing to recognize the pattern. Soeurette decides to stop dating dudes altogether. She decides to go lesbian, and decides to start dating this lesbian named Charlotte. Soeurette goes to Charlotte's house, and they start making out. And then, they start making love. It's really hot. And the film ends with Soeurette and Charlotte making love, and then finally deciding to make a baby together with the help of a sperm donor. 
The message of this film is that people often go through the same struggles over and over again, never learning from their mistakes.
 We all know someone like that. The film is actually very relatable. It's one of the reasons why it's so popular. ",40,2,13,0,25,37,28,9,4,24,0.0,0.325,0.625,0.4183206106870229

 have been on a few dating apps and it's just not the same as meeting someone in person.
 It made sense to me at first, all the algorithms figuring out who is best for you but what they dont do is put you next to the person right away so your biochemistry can help signal you one way or another. Pheromones and other biological signals that the body and mind silently sends out and picks up on is essential at finding a suitable, compatible mate.  think people are missing out on the real thing,aand it might be that dating mostly becomes a digital interaction using one of several devices. They they will soon mostly meet up in virtual reality, totally bypassing the full physical experience. I think that dating apps are a great way to meet people, but I don't think that they should be used as athe only way of interacting with them. People need to meet, they need to interact in person and need to exchange all the information that comes with being next to a real person. There should be an option on the dating apps that tell a potential match that they must meet in person soon after they agree that they are possibly compatible. So in my mind, the old fashioned way is still the best but using dating sites for the initial meeting is understandable but physically being with a person on a date is far superior to just having interactions over the internet.

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks are superior to reading books.  When you listen to an audiobook, it makes me feel we are honoring the oral traditions of our ancestors.  Before writing become common place, human's stories were passed orally.   A travelling author may go from town to town spreading his story.   People would gather together to listen to the storyteller, and the story itself would be interpreted and revised by the townspeople.   Listening to audiobooks continues that tradition.

Additionally, I believe it is easier to use your imagination when the story is being read to you.  When reading, there are times when I have to re-read sentences over again because the sentences appeared ""odd"" while reading them.  While listening to an audiobook, I don't have to worry about this issue.   I feel that listening to the audiobook is less mentally demanding than reading.  I am really able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the literature.

Reading books is still entertaining to me.  However, I think that listening to audiobooks with a great narrator is much more enjoyable.  Some audiobooks may have different sound effects that are added throughout the reading.  This helps to immerse yourself even more into the book.  When a scene in the book has rain, and you can hear a rain sound effect in the audiobook, I feel like I am living in the scene.

Another benefit of audiobooks is I am able to listen to the audiobooks while exercising or travelling.  I am able to perform other tasks while listening to the books which is great.

Overall, reading books is a pleasurable experience.  I think that utilizing an audiobook is even more pleasurable.  I suggest everyone try an audiobook at least once.",27,7,17,1,2,6,3,3,1,2,0.037037037037037035,0.6296296296296297,0.1111111111111111,0.5295857988165681

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come with using audiobooks. I do use audiobooks but I actually prefer to read physical books. That is just a personal preference I have because I love holding the physical book in my hands for whatever reason. 

An audiobook has the ability to be much more convenient than a physical book. I can listen to an audiobook in bed in the dark, on a train where it's noisy and crowed and even when I am driving to work.

I also love the ability to listen to the audiobook at a faster speed. I know many people listen to their audiobooks at 1.5 speed and are still able to retain the information. This makes reading a lot more efficient. 

I think there are also advantages that come with reading a book compared to listening to one. For example, some people are much better learners when they read or see something compared to when they hear something. Visual learners are very common in our world. 

I also just love holding a physical book. I love being able to feel the pages and flip through them. I love being able to look at the pictures in the middle. I love being able to feel the cover and I also collect a bunch of book covers to help save space. 

I prefer reading a book because it's just a habit for me. I have been reading physical books since I was a child. It simply just feels right. 

I think both methods are fantastic overall. Any way that we can increase the amount we read is beneficial to us. Audiobooks have made reading a lot more convenient and portable. 

Audiobooks are great and physical books are great. I'll be using both of them in the future and don't plan to stop.",29,7,22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.7586206896551724,0.0,0.47752808988764045

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is very important. I think everyone should have some background knowledge about what's going on in the world, even if they don't follow it closely. It helps to shape your world view and helps you form your own opinions. 

This pandemic is a perfect example of what happens when certain people do not follow the news. Those who don't follow the news are often in denial of realities like this. People have denied that coronavirus exists despite the news telling them otherwise. Some people even seem proud to ignore news unless it is conspiracy theory based. That's why many Republicans believe that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. They only listen to news that is extreme and doesn't report the actual truth or they don't listen to the news at all and just listen to their friends. These people are proud to be American but they are not doing their duty to be informed. 

I think it's too vague to just say people keep up with the news or not. Even if you do watch the news, you may not be watching a very informative program. Morning shows for example tend to be more sugar coated. People watch it to stay informed but aren't getting as much information. Often times you need to watch national news to hear what is really going on in our country. Sometimes people want to avoid such grim news so they prefer the friendly morning show format. However they need to know what is happening. 
If people do not know what’s happening in their own country, they cannot hold their leaders accountable.
 That's exactly why Donald Trump did not lose by a landslide. People weren't informed. That's all there is to it. So yes, I do think people have some responsibility to know what is going on. Otherwise they can't make informed decisions and when things go wrong they are partially to blame. They may try to shift the blame but they are just as at fault as the next uninformed American.

For the past 11 years, members of the world fought over limited resources, and conflicts of interests between the NATO and WARSAW, which had formed once again with new countries in the year 2060. Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. For many countries, the massive war was a costly endeavor, not only taking the lives of 15 million around the world, but devastating the lands of the countries where many battles took place. For 50 years, countries complied to the agreement, going into isolation and focusing on recuperating its losses from the war.

50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn other countries did not follow the agreement for isolation. Most of the countries of the world had deceived the US, fooling it into going into isolation while the other countries remained connected. For many, it was the only way to truly recover from the war, as they lacked resources to repair and restore its many cities and infrastructure. The US was not the only country to be fooled, as many countries around the world were in the same situation. Yes, many were deceived and found themselves struggling in the past 50 years to recuperate their losses. The US, despite the isolation , had managed to recuperate its losses and had become a world power once again. However, other countries had managed due to the same, with the help of other countries that assisted them by feinting isolation. The US despite feeling deceived, decided against starting a new war, realizing the futility of engaging with other countries that could easily counter with its own military might. 

owever, the US did not want to be left behind, and decided to form its own alliance with other countries that were also deceived.
 There was a numerable amount of countries that had gone into isolation, many of which were once enemies of the US in World War III. Forming a new alliance, the US offered aid and military support to those countries, which in turned accepted such support by joining the alliance. The other countries were not so quick to form such alliances, and found themselves forming smaller groups that were overshadowed by the new US alliance. he US alliance, which was later named the Allied Nations, was a powerful force, and quickly became the most powerful alliance in the world.
 Although they avoided further conflicts due to a mix of diplomacy and military force, it was unsure whether many believed that the Allied Nations would continue to avoid major conflicts, much less a war. 

For many, the Allied Nations was a pivotal event in history that stemmed from the isolation that lasted for many for 50 years.

---

Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Sure: it makes you depressed and hopeless. Let's face it, the world is going straight to hell. Climate change is making the planet uninhabitable, terror groups roam swathes of the Earth virulent and unchecked, and political opportunists publish lies that weaponize the stupid. Any level-headed reading of recent news will surely convince you things are hopeless. So, why read news at all?

Unfortunately, not reading the news comes with its own risks. If you don't know what's going on, things can, well, catch you by surprise. You can catch COVID if you didn't know about prevention, or can be thought a fool if you can't carry a literate conversation at an after-work party.

So what's the solution? How can you be informed without being hopeless? How can you carry a literate conversation without making yourself miserable?
Here's how:
 develop a list of literate-sounding things to say, memorize, and deploy them. That's how most people sound intelligent at parties after all. Practice saying things like: ""I've never heard that put so well before,"" ""Yes, we live in interesting times, don't we,"" and ""That's just so interesting,"" to name just three.

You can seem to be in the know, when in reality you haven't looked at the news in decades. I mean, you'll be dead in the end anyway, and reading the news won't change that. So why not hit the retirement years worry free — or as worry free as possible anyway.
If you choose that route remember: always answer in the affirmative, it is the path of least resistance.
 It's much easier to say ""yes"" than to offer a dissenting opinion.

Just watch people gravitate toward you, admiring smiles on their lips. You will come off as worldly, intelligent, and in control of your own destiny. 

And if you really want to hear yourself talk, consider running for office. Most politicians are already following this simple plan.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, people should acknowledge and monitor their screen use diligently. Many research and studies show that excessive screen use can have a variety of issues in a person. Most notably, this includes eye strain and fatigue, headaches, and sleep disorders. Too much screen use before bed can worsen a person's insomnia, and affect their mood if their sleep is disrupted. In fact, organizations such as he World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people limit their screen time to two hours per day.
 However, is such limits practical for the majority of people who find themselves having to work on screens for work, or even those that engage with others via social media? 

The reality is that such limits are impractical for most, and some other type of moderation is required that is tailored to a specific individual.  believe that people should be more aware of their screen use, and be more conscious of how much time they spend on their screens.
 This can easily be done by checking system settings and seeing total screen time, or by manually counting how often a person is on their devices. Ideally, screen use should be limited if not avoided prior to going to bed, if not possible a blue light filter should be used to reduce blue light exposure, which studies have shown affect the sleep cycle's of people. Use of blue light filters in general can reduce the drawbacks of prolonged screen use, and can be used to reduce eye strain, headaches, and fatigue. However, care should still be taken by the individual, taking breaks now and then from staring on a screen, to say standing up, and disengaging from their devices.

Overall, the pandemic has shown that avoiding the transition of dependency or heavy use of digital devices is futile, given how many people benefit from their devices, and the inevitable transition of work from more traditional means to being online-oriented. However, the pandemic has also shown that we should be more aware of our screen use, and take breaks from staring at screens. Being too dependent on social interactions online can affect the mood and temperament of an individual. Social interactions in person is still critical for many people, who require such interactions to feel connected and to have a stable mood. Thus, it is key that people find a balance in their life, especially during the pandemic and other times where they are unable to interact with others in person to moderate their screen use, to maximize its benefits and reduce its drawbacks. Most people have the ability to moderate themselves and avoid incurring negative health consequences, people in society have the means to learn how and resources should be available. For that, I believe it is unnecessary for most to worry about the dangers of dependency on digital devices and screen use.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I do not believe that schools should provide free pads and tampons for students.  The school should not have to worry about feminine products for the students.  This should be the responsibility of the student's parental guardians.    The main focus of school should be learning.  Now, if the school wants to set the students up with caregiving programs that will provide these items to the students, then I think that is fine.    I do not believe that the school should be required to provide these items.   Products like these can eat into already low budget of many school systems.

Additionally, it is not the school's responsibility to provide certain necessities for the students.  If there is a student who is a Type 1 Diabetic, it is not the school's responsibility to provide that student with insulin.  The student's parents are responsible for providing that.  I do believe that there needs to be some sort of program that will address these needs if the parental guardians can't do it.  However, these programs should be independent from the school.  

I think that many school systems would have a hard time getting funding to buy feminine products.  That is more of a reason why schools should not be required to provide these products.    Students may become dependent on the school to provide the product.  If the school system is having a hard time getting the budget for these products, it can leave the students surprised and in a bad position. 

Ultimately, schools number one focus should be education.  If these schools have to divert their time to other non-education areas, I believe this will harm the school's ability to educate.  Schools should pass off the responsibility of providing pads and tampons to other programs that are independent of the schools.",25,7,14,0,4,7,4,3,2,2,0.0,0.56,0.16,0.4223433242506812

She gets up in a frenzy and runs over to the bathroom holding a towel. She looks at herself in the mirror in anguish, and just stares for a minute or two. After she has calmed herself she decides to face what she has brought on to herself. She exits the bathroom and sits on the bed, only to find that the person next to her was simply the previous guy she had dated and broken up with.

In my opinion, the topic of periods is often still taboo, but it shouldn't be. Girls should be taught about their bodies and how to take care of them in health or sex education class, along with boys. So, regardless of what they've been taught at home, the school should aim to ensure that no young woman is startled, or dismayed, if she has her first period at school, and of course , that she has the necessary supplies to deal with it.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, or Band-Aids? hey are all hygiene products that are necessary ,fat times, or a person's health and well-being.
 How are they different? They are only different because they are often not provided for free in schools, and they are only used by girls. This is not a coincidence. The reason they aren't provided to girls, is because of the stigma around periods, as expressed by the patriarchy, and represents a form of discrimination against women. It's sexism, plain and simple.

So, this is something that needs to be addressed along with all the other manifestations of patriarchal sexism that are still present in our schools, holding girls down. In this sense, it represents a tremendous opportunity, because it is something that can be changed, and it is something that can be changed immediately, and it could be used as a simple 'lever' to help bring the entire patriarchy tumbling down.

So girls should not only be provided with free pads and tampons in schools, and educated about periods, but boys should also be taught about periods, and how to help their sisters, friends, and girlfriends. They should be encouraged to think of it as a duty, and inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail at it. Any instances of period shaming should be dealt with swiftly and severely. If all of these practices are adhered to, period shaming will be a thing of the past, and girls will be able to feel comfortable talking about their periods, and will be able to take care of themselves properly. Also, boys will receive some much-needed improvement, because they will be able to help their female friends and sisters, and will be more aware of the needs of women in general.

In short, the humble issue of periods, which I've never had to deal with, being male, will be a fantastic opportunity to take yet another step towards gender equality, and the glorious society of tomorrow.",25,7,5,1,12,26,15,11,2,13,0.04,0.2,0.52,0.4359504132231405

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to work and collaborate with others, how to be flexible and accommodating for unexpected obstacles or setbacks, and learning how to set goals to achieve alongside feasible plans in their daily lives. I think this is more important than learning facts in a textbook, which might be circumstantial and not useful in many applications, or grades that are given based on it which only serve to gauge performance in specific metrics. 

The most important thing that I have learned in school is being able to persevere and also confine in my abilities as well as the skills and expertise of others. It has helped me succeed many times, such as when I needed to write an report as well as lead a group presentation with individuals that I might not be too familiar with. Lacking a basic confidence in one's ability and or trust in others increases doubt, and can ultimately cause a decrease in performance. Throughout life, there will no doubt be unexpected situations or stressful periods of time that ultimately challenges a person. Learning how to handle these situations is crucial to ones success in school as well as later on in life. I know that believing in myself and others will help in my career and or other opportunities I experience in my life. Trust is critical in group situations, which I face a good portion at work. Without trust, cohesion is affected and you are forced to work individually when many tasks require the work efforts and skill set of others. For those reasons and more, I believe students benefit from a school experience as it helps them work well with others, to build self-confidence and their self-esteem along with the ability to confine in colleagues, friends, and other people they will encounter in life.",16,6,7,0,3,7,3,4,3,0,0.0,0.4375,0.1875,0.5054054054054054

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, reading a book is better than listening to audiobooks. With my limited time in listening to audiobooks, I still feel that reading is better for me. With reading, you get to imagine the tone, the details, and the talk of the characters. The author intends to make you imagine and describe all the details, yes. But, things like tone, and the way of speaking of the characters are so much better imagined by picturing the words that you read in your head than by making a narrator read it for you. It might be better and more immersive, but why are you listening to an audiobook if you want an immersive experience, why not just have a friend tell you about all the details instead or just watch a movie?

Sure, you can also argue that listening to audiobooks are also great to do at the same time as something else that you need both hands for, like driving or cooking, which is why audiobooks are great for those things. So if you're always busy and you're always on the go, listening to audiobooks are great for you. However, reading books shouldn't be a second choice for something, it should be the primary thing people do to read books. You shouldn't multitask if you're going to read a book. Once you read a book, all you have to do is let your mind soak all the details, no paying attention to your phone calls, watching television, or just anything else. 
One more argument against audiobooks is that they are expensive and ehard to set up. You have to have an account with Audible that is connected to your credit card and you have to buy the audiobook which costs around $15. There's also no way for you to return it, unlike books. Pictures and Illustrations are also absent from audiobooks, because it is only the voice of the narrator. The narrator, in which you mostly do not also have the choice of. I hate it when the narrator doesn't sound how you would imagine the characters to sound like in your mind, the same way as with the books turned into movies where the actors don't look like their description or someone else that you would've imagined for the role. 

As for conserving trees and preventing climate change, sure. You got me there. But books are also saving on paper by the way. They save paper by the virtual bookshelf full of e-books that are available online. E-books are getting really popular nowadays and even more accessible and very more forgiving for your internet bandwidth. 

So in short, audiobooks are ok if you're busy and on the go, but I believe The Written Word (books) are better, more honest, and a lot more enjoyable. I hope you agree with me and you open your first book to read in a while. Happy reading!",31,7,10,0,14,20,19,1,0,19,0.0,0.3225806451612903,0.45161290322580644,0.43462246777163904

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should provide pads and tampons for students that need it.  I don't see these products as being different from toilet paper or Band-Aids.  There are certain biological needs that students have and schools should help these students.   There should be no shame in having a period.  I do believe that the reason some schools may not provide products like this is shame.   Menstrual shaming is the perfect example of women being shamed and made to feel uncomfortable about their natural process. 

A period is a natural process.  There are certain needs when a person is undergoing this natural process.  Therefore, schools should not be afraid to provide products to help a student going through this natural process.   By providing feminine products to students who need it, this allows them to focus on learning.  I believe schools should be able to provide whatever resources they can to allow students to achieve their best possible scholastic performance.  

MIf I student gets injured and is bleeding, schools don't waste a second thought sending that student to the nurse and giving the student a Band-Aid.  Schools can perform well in addressing the health problems of students in many different areas.  I believe helping students undergoing their period is another area where the schools can provide help.  If a student is unable to focus on their school work because they are in the middle of getting their period, then it is time for the schools to step up.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, I am not surprised at all that humans have empathy for animals compared to strangers. Most of us who have pets consider animals to be part of our family. If an animal is getting beaten, it doesn't really have a way to defend itself. A human has the ability to defend itself and to fight back. Humans are stronger and more powerful than most animals so it would be disgusting to harm one. 

I also don't think it has to be a black and white issue. We should care about both humans suffering as well as an animal's welfare. For whatever reason, we as humans just love dogs. I love my dog. He is the best dog in the world in my opinion. I consider him to be my family. And I'm not sure why I feel that way, I just do. 

I want to do everything I can to stop animal cruelty and I also want to do everything I can to prevent humans from suffering. The problem is no matter how hard we try, it will be impossible to eradicate either issue from our world. There are always going to be bad human beings in this world that like to cause harm to both people and animals. Those people absolutely disgust me and should be in jail.

Think about how many people are murdered each day. Think about how many people are robbed at gunpoint. Think about how many animals are just dropped off on the side of the road. A bunch of people are heartless and have no conscience. There is always going to be evil in this world sadly.

What us good people can do is help our fellow man and give love and care to our animals. We also can say something if we see something. If I see a person or an animal being mistreated, I'm going to step in every time and try to correct that wrong. 

Human beings love things that we can take care of. That includes our family, our friends and our animals. We also love things that love us back and once again our friends, family and animals give us that love back. We have an emotional bond and a strong connection with them that can't be replaced. 

As humans we can care about humans and animals at the same time. That is what I have done my entire life and that is not going to change. ",36,7,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.8055555555555556,0.0,0.4416826003824092

Then you go on to speak about all of the camping trips you took together. You remind him of traveling to Canada when other kids were stuck at home for the summer. You see your father being drawn out of his shell, and notice his face seems lighter with happiness and less filled with worry. You continue to talk about happy times. The trip to Washington D.C., riding the subway in Toronto, going to Florida on Spring break. 

As you continue to talk, you notice that your dad is actually starting to smile. He seems to have forgotten all about the mug, and is focused on what you are saying.

You mention how he gave you away at your first wedding, and how he supported you went your second marriage was failing. You thank him for picking up the pieces with you every time your life seemed to be coming apart. The happiness he has given to you as you have gotten older, and the concern and love he shows for your children are more ways you are grateful to have him as your father.

In my opinion, the people who think animals are more important then people are not following the word of our lord. He said that man was to rule over all animals and use them as man sees fit. It is not just wrong its evil to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we should be focusing on helping people.

In my opinion, technology is just another tool at our disposal so it is going to be used for dating and when in a relationship whether we like it or not.

Or up to us to make sure we are able to utilize technology in a way that doesnt take away from our relationship once we are in one. I think dating apps are a huge asset to the dating life of individuals. I think they really put you out there to a much larger variety of people opposed to meeting people at specific locations. There are people out there like single moms and dads who simply would not be able to meet anyone else without the use of a dating app. With the dating app, they actually find very high quality relationships with people who are looking for the same thing that they are. I personally met my wife on a dating app and would never have met someone so compatible without the app itself. If i did then it most likely would have taken much longer than it did with the app. I think dating apps are one of the best parts of technology if used right. Of course there are going to be people who abuse the privledge and use it to only try to hook up and harass people, but this comes with any good thing out there. Eggs are on of the healthiest foods on the planet, but that means that farmers are going to try to mass produce and drug their animals to make a ton of them. If you feed the animals healthy food and let them out in the sun on a pasture, they are going to produce great quality eggs! Its just the same thing with dating apps.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters that I see or read about that makes me cringe are the ones that are ultimately derivative, lazy, and plain hurtful to the people they are stereotyping. It could be somewhat of a mild trope being shown, and I would react with a mild discomfort as well. However, if the trope or stereotype is taken to an extreme, or if it is a one that I feel is being used to make fun of a group of people, my reaction would be much more significant and negative. 
I would not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I can understand that the author came from a different time period, where such portrayals were the norm, but I would not want to support that kind of thinking. I don't find a strong value in reading books with characters that are offensive portrayal of others, in fact I think that those types of books do more harm than good. I believe that for whatever reason the author or creator of the content with stereotypical books, movies or television shows, they are not doing a service to the people that they are stereotyping. 

The characters that are practically stereotypes do harm as they effectively continue the concept of stereotypes, and reinforce the beliefs people hold in society regarding stereotypes. Instead of breaking the norm and portraying characters in a more respectful and realistic manner, stereotypical characters are viewed as no more than their stereotypes and often negative traits, which can depict groups of people as inferior or less equal to other groups. Therefore, I believe people should support shows and other content that refrains from implementing stereotypes and stereotypical characters. The benefits from lacking such characters in a story can go a long way, and it is critical for these types of stories to become widespread for people to view all groups as equal, and to avoid stereotyping them for certain traits or qualities.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on Animal Welfare when human beings are suffering.   t is a fact that animals are suffering more than humans.
  Human beings are encroaching on the habitat of animals.  We are running them out of their homes.  Humans are also harming and killing animals.   You have cosmetic and pharmaceutical companies that are using animals for experiments.  Humans harm animals more than animals harm humans.  I think it is only right to put more of a focus on animal suffering than human suffering.

I do not believe we should show no sympathy to human suffering.  I just believe that animals deserve more of our sympathy than humans.  I think it is wrong to focus on human suffering when animals are suffering more.   Morally, I believe this is the right thing to do.  You place more of a focus where there is a greater need.   

I think many people are empathetic towards animal suffering because they understand that human beings have endangered many of these animals.  These animals are just trying to survive.   Humans are taking away their homes and food.  If you look at wolves in certain areas of the world, you will see that they are killed by humans if they attack the human's livestock.   These wolves are just doing what is natural to them.  It is the humans fault for decreasing the territories of many of these animals.

Animals feel pain just like humans do.  They feel fear and trauma.  I think that humans have a duty to prevent as much harm against animals as possible.   I know it can be hard to put an animal over a human being because we have so many personal interactions with humans.  But, we also have personal interactions with our wildlife.  We have to protect them.   We have to protect the animals that cannot protect themselves.",32,7,17,1,7,11,8,3,6,2,0.03125,0.53125,0.25,0.42857142857142855

One day, Rachel, a beautiful young woman, is walking home from work when she’s attacked by a man. The man pulls Rachel into a dark alley, away from the bustling city street. Another man, John, happens to see Rachel getting attacked by the stranger, and decides to help. He grabs the man from behind and shoves him away from Rachel into a pile of garbage bags. The man turns around and looks at John, and then runs away. Rachel is relieved that the man has left her alone, thanks in part to John, who helped her. John and Rachel get to talking, and they realize they have a lot in common. Rachel decides to thank John by going on a date with him to a small, coffee shop the following day. Rachel meets John at the coffee shop and they get to know each other better over cappuccinos. Rachel gets a strange feeling that she knows John very well, but she can't put her finger on it. She dismisses the feeling and they go on a few more dates, and they fall in love. As time goes on, Rachel and John fall deeper in love with each other.

One day, Rachel goes to the store alone and tells John that she will be back shortly. John stays at home and says he has work to do and catch up on. One hour later, Rachel returns from the store and sees John in the backyard acting strange.  Rachel goes to the backyard to see what John is doing, and she sees John digging a hole in the ground.

In my opinion, yes, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to students who need them.  believe that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
. I also believe that having access to those items can protect students from experiencing the shame that can go with not being able to afford these items. And that could also mean protecting them from humiliation if others see or if, heaven forbid, another student vocally ridicules them. I've heard opponents of my opinion suggest that pads and tampons are very different from the Band-Aids and other items I've mentioned because they are used my all genders. But in response, I would say that without period items supplied, females are unfairly more vulnerable to this type of embarrassment from which they should be protected in order for things to be truly fair. 
I have experienced what they call ""period poverty"" myself. It's horrible and distracting to deal with. I can imagine that it would interfere with a young lady's education for sure.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.
Thus begins the story of the ""Lost Generations"" in this thought-provoking speculative sci-fi novel.
 To save their own lives, the Lost Generations develop technologies to prevent aging. They build self-sustaining orbital habitats and highly automated underground cities, and develop gene therapy to eliminate aging. Their drug is better and more effective than the one that was initially given to everyone under age 26. As the Lucky Ones went on with their lives, blissfully unaware that they were ticking time bombs for horrid side effects, The Lost ones were building and evolving and making their own spaces better in the world. And when the side effects finally came, they were prepared.

The side effects hit the Lucky Ones with the blow of a bull hitting the matador. They were unprepared and unwilling to accept that their mortality may one day be imminent. The side effects were so terrible that all they could think of was death. The pain, the blinding lights, the thundering sounds in their ears were all too terrible for the Lucky population to endure. During this time of horror above ground, the Lost were living below the surface. Watching the scene unfold on cameras and biding their time for when they could once again regain control of the Earth from the childish Lucky. 
The Lucky Ones knew they needed to do something, anything, to end the suffering.
 Even though they were filled with hatred for the original recipients of the miracle medication, they also had some compassion that remained which didn't allow them to let other creatures endure prolonged suffering. It was once again a case of the haves and have nots. Only instead of money or wealth as in the previous world order, it was life or death. The Lost decided they must do something they never thought they would. They must give their proven, more effective miracle medicine to all of the Lucky ones.  So they did. Again, the results were instantaneous. The suffering would end. But not as the Lost imagined it would, with a cure for the Lucky and renewed immortality. But with a pop and bang and puff of smoke as the Lucky simply vanished off the face of the Earth. 
After the death of the Lucky, the remaining Lost colonies began to form their own governments and figure out what to do next.
 It was decided that they must not allow the same mistakes of their previous society to be repeated. So they pulled the best, brightest and most intelligent minds from each of the remaining colonies. These people began to work on a new and improved drug for immortality in the event the same situation were to strike them that had been inflicted upon the Lucky. 
And again, their efforts were successful.
 But the strain of creating this drug took its toll on the minds and bodies of these remaining individuals, so they built a home for themselves in space where they could work in peace and quiet on their next miracle drug.",33,3,16,8,6,18,14,4,0,14,0.24242424242424243,0.48484848484848486,0.42424242424242425,0.48028673835125446

In my opinion, it’s time to stop worrying about screen time. The world was already changing and with the pandemic we've reached a point of no return. This is the new reality, and we need to learn how to live, work and play in increasingly more social, increasingly more digital environments.

So how do we get the most from screen time to our benefit?
 We just look at our daily activities and figure out ways to put a positive spin on them. For example. maybe you use the internet to look for upcoming movies. Try looking for documentaries instead that can help you learn something new. Maybe you are looking for a new restaurant. Instead you could find a new recipe to make. o, figure out what you are doing on your screen and make it work for you.
 Turn a time killer into something useful or positive.

We just need to move past the debate of screen time and just develop a realistic mindset of where we are at. o go forth, use your screens and make them work for you.
 Learn something new or develop a new skill online via videos. The world has changed. We have to accept that and adapt to that. The sooner we do that the sooner we'll all be on the same page.

 The Zora Chronicles. 
The Zora Chronicles was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Limited Series in 2010.
 
The Zora Chronicles was also nominated for the Harvey Award for Best New Series in 2010.
 As you can imagine, the Zora Chronicles were wildly popular and many people loved them, regardless of age. 
The Zora Chronicles has been optioned for a film by the production company, The Gotham Group.
 The film is expected to be released in September 2022. One little boy named Johnny is particularly excited about the release of the film. He is a huge fan of the Zora Chronicles and has read all of the books. One day, a producer named Mike reaches out to Johnny. He has heard about Johnny's love and passion for the Zora Chronicles because Johnny runs a dedicated Instagram page and blog featuring content about the series. Mike asks Johnny to come to the set of the film for a special role. Johnny is absolutely thrilled. He never imagined that he could become a big-time star for his favorite series on the big screen. Johnny is so excited that he can't wait to tell his friends. But he is surprised when his friends aren't excited for him. In fact, they are downright jealous. Johnny's friends are all big fans of the Zora Chronicles, too. But they are upset that Johnny got the role instead of them. They don't want to see Johnny succeed.

Johnny's friends are furious that Johnny is ignoring them.
 But Johnny proves to Mike that he can handle his cool, and Mike is impressed with Johnny's sensibilities in ignoring his former friends. Mike offers Johnny a full-time contract for other movies and that is how Johnny began his career in the movie industry. After that, the green-eyed monsters had nothing more to say.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology both improves and worsens dating experiences depending on how you use it. There are pros and cons to everything and dating apps and websites are no different. Many people have had success with dating apps. People meet on the app and fast forward 5-10 years and they're married. 

Technology has helped ease the stress and anxiety that goes into dating. I don't care who you are, there is always nerves when you're meeting someone for the first time that you're attracted to. Luckily, technology allows us to break the ice and speak to those people before meeting them in person. FaceTime allows us to confirm that the person we're talking to on the other side is real and isn't a Catfish as well.

Speaking of Catfish, that is definitely a negative aspect of dating technology. There even was a television show made about it. Catfishing is simply using someone else's profile picture on a dating app to trick them into thinking they're talking to someone that they're not actually talking to. Catfishing has been used for revenge as well as in scenarios where the catfishers just have very low self esteem.

Another positive aspect of technology that probably doesn't get talked about enough is the ability to catch someone cheating with evidence. This evidence can be via photograph, video or text messages. Now you might be thinking this is a negative aspect but to me, it's a positive.

If you were being cheated on, would you want to know or would you rather never know and your partner is screwing you over on a daily basis and being with someone else. Sure the pain in the beginning hurts really bad but that pain is only temporary. That pain isn't as bad as being married to someone that is a cheater and doesn't truly love you.

So in general, dating apps and websites and other technology have both a positive and negative affect on relationships. Since I am an optimist, I would say that the good outweighs the bad.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, nothing compares with a real book. I have no argument with audiobooks, but when it comes to pure enjoyment and pleasure, nothing beats a real book in my hands; feeling the paper, the weight, turning the pages, smelling and feeling the book jacket, seeing my neat handwriting on the inside page of the front cover. 

I love to get an interesting or unusual book from a library, antique store or a friend, and then get to know the book and its quirks and treasures. An historic, leather-bound book is a delight, a sensory pleasure. The smell of an old leather-bound book is a metaphor for the wisdom and beauty locked inside.

n audiobook is not quite the same experience.
  Screens and electronics are everywhere, and the last thing I want to do after a day of working on the computer is go to bed with a gadget. 
S favor real books that I can hold in my hands, and turn the pages lovingly.
 The book itself is part of the experience, and I feel cheated when I listen to an audio-book. I feel almost as if someone might ""steal the soul"" out of the book for me, if I had to listen to it as an audiobook. 

You miss out on a lot when you listen rather than go through the book yourself. Some of it is simply the physical experience. You don't enjoy the book in the same way, and you don't form the same attachments. You don't write in it, you don't look at the photos or illustrations in it.  I wonder how much of the story is lost because it is read to you, rather than read by yourself.

Reading a book is like meeting another person face-to-face.  Audiobooks are like meeting them via social media or a dating app. They are very different things! And there's nothing wrong with either one, but neither can take the place of the other. For me, my true love is a book I can hold.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I believe that humans have been on earth far longer than animals and, therefore, have more experience and knowledge of the world in which we live to deal with their suffering. In comparison, animals have not evolved for as long and do not know their way of the world as well as we do. As a consequence, they usually do not know how to actively change their circumstances. For example, if they are being abused, they do not know how to get away from their abusers. Whereas, humans can run away and protect themselves. In addition, animals are usually not able to speak for themselves so it is up to us as human beings to advocate for them; they cannot do it themselves. Then, there is the subject of intelligence. I believe that since animals are not as intelligent as humans (this is my opinion, based on the information I have been taught) , if they suffer, they are not able to take action to stop it because they are limited in their intelligence and cannot think it through to save themselves. We, humans, are able to think through our own suffering and plan our own escape from it. I also believe that, since we are more intelligent, our morals are greater and therefore, we should feel more empathy for animal suffering. Animal suffering is a real problem. To conclude, I think that it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

In my opinion, I really don't buy it. I don't buy the idea that people would care about an animal over caring about a tourist being beaten with any kind of weapon. I believe that most people no matter who they are would chose saving a human over an animal. If you saw a dog and a person both drowning at the same time, and could only save the life of one, I doubt that most people would save the dog. You see this, unfortunately, all the time with police officers and firefighters. They will run into a burning building and look for people first, then any pets or animals. In the same way, if a couple is driving down the road and their car breaks down, there would be a people that would stop to offer their help. To suggested otherwise is basically like saying all human beings are mostly monsters who do not care about other people. I find that false, because I have also experienced almost being robbed in a foreign country in south east asia. There were two guys who chased of the mugger, and made sure I was ok before sending me on my way and telling me to try to be careful.

254,06239d83b27840aaa169512cc8babda0.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, a person is ultimately the one that dictates the level of risk and or safety they can undertake in their life. What they decide to do with their life, is primarily their decision. Risky sports such as extreme mountain climbing, is an active decision that people take, just like other athletes that perform less risky sports. Extreme sports are not for everyone, but for those that do choose to participate, it is their choice to do so. They are not forced to do so, nor are the dangers hidden from them when they being investing time in the sport. Less dangerous sports will always draw more people to it, primarily for the ease in getting proficient in said sports, but also the fact that such sports will not injure them if precautions are taken. The same can be applied to extreme sports, as mountain climbing can be done in a risky manner, or in a way that minimizes dangers and reduces the risk for the person. 

Whether a sport is then too dangerous does not change its classification, as sports are labeled not based on the risk involved in the sport, but rather how the person engages in it, and whether they compete or even cooperate with others. Extreme sports follow the same set of guidelines as many less risky sports, but are associated with more risk. For example, people wishing to mountain climb must learn proper techniques, invest in proper equipment, and even train on less tasking mountains before tackling more dangerous and demanding climbs. The same is true for other extreme sports. 

As for when a sport becomes unreasonable or still within reason depends primarily on the person, specifically their skill, physique, and mindset. For example, a person who is not in good physical shape, or does not have the proper mindset to climb a mountain, will be more likely to get injured on the climb than a more experienced climber. Thus we could say for the person that it is unreasonable for them to continue to mountain climb, until they get more experience and training. There might as well be some level that is unobtainable for athletes and participants of an extreme sport, that might be considered based on risk and danger to be unreasonable to undertake no matter the physique and training said participants may have. Ideally, they ought to be well informed of the risks and dangers, and well-prepared for the sport. To disregard such considerations is to make the sport more risky than it already is, but many do make such considerations. n the end, it is up to the person to decide what they are willing to risk in their life., and what sort of achievements they wish to accomplish, either for the notoriety or for some sense of self-worth.

World War III was a devastating, violent affair, that took a heavy toll on the nations of the world. The United States was hit particularly hard, with the majority of its major cities being destroyed. The American food production infrastructure was hit particularly hard, causing massive waves of starvation and famine within every social class. America, like many nations of the world, were forced to rebuild its cities, economies and food production. he United States government, in order to prevent another World War, decided to isolate itself from the rest of the world for 50 years.
 The other foreign nations also agreed to isolate for 50 years, in order to re-establish society and humanity. At first, it was tough, people were suffering from hunger, unemployment, and nightmares from the war. America did not trust the other nations to isolate as promised, expecting a surprise attack at any moment. However, as the years went on, and the world rebuilt itself, the fear of another war was gone. People established their daily routines, rebuilt cities, and had grown delicious food to feed the populace. Everything had gone back to normal, with people finding jobs and starting families again. The year was 2052, and the United States was ready to re-enter the world. The American government held grueling meetings to decide if it was a good time to come out of isolation, and reconnect with the world.  The American people were divided on whether or not to come out of hiding and risk another war. Many people were afraid that the other nations would not honor the 50 year agreement and attack the United States, while others were afraid that the United States would attack first and risk the lives of all Americans. The American government decided to come out of isolation, and see what the world was like. Messages were sent to many foreign countries to establish a network once more. After a few hours, there was no response from any foreign nation. The American government was surprised that nobody had answered. The American government decided to send a team of diplomats to the United Nations to see what was going on. When the diplomats arrived, the United Nations was eerily empty, like a haunted house on Halloween. The diplomats searched the premises for any signs of life, but found none. They contacted the American government to let them know that there were no signs of life. The diplomats decided to fly to Europe and investigate the situation there. When they arrived, they found the same thing, no signs of life. Only empty streets and desolate buildings filled the atmosphere with sounds of hollow winds. Finally, One of the diplomats discovered a skeleton in the middle of the street. The skeleton was dressed in tattered, lavish clothing, resembling those of a high ranking official. The diplomats decided to investigate the skeleton, and found a note in the pocket of the skeleton. The note contained a grim warning meant for the world, especially America. One day after America had gone into isolation, a deadly plague had spread like wildfire throughout the remaining nations. Human life was wiped out quickly, but had spared America because they were isolated from every other country, and had closed their borders. The diplomats sent the message to the American government, telling them of the grim outcome. The American government was devastated by the news, but they had no choice but to accept it. All of these years, the American populace was alone on planet Earth, filled with false hopes of a better future. The American government decided to let the populace know of the grim outcome, and to let them know that they were alone on Earth. The American people had no choice but to continue living and pushing forward. As time went on, people slowly repopulated the other landmasses that once belonged to foreign nations. Scientists discovered the cure for the plague, so that people would survive. The United States was the only nation to survive the plague, and was the only nation to survive the war.

The first, is that the majority of the world's Dads become very angry and depressed upon learning their real rankings. The second, is that the actual ""Best Dad"" in the world becomes a figure of worldwide attention and worship, as dads try to gain his favor in a variety of ways, hoping to increase their dad ranking. However, a few embittered low-ranking dads form a terrorist group called ""PTA"" (People to Take Action) and begin to plot revenge against the actual Best Dad, which leads to an eventual plot to kill him.

In the meantime, the Best Dad has become the leader of a cult-like organization, the Dad Council, that rapidly grows in power and influence. Their aims are benign though, since they seek to bring about world peace by encouraging fathers to spend more time with their families, and as a side-effect of having more time with their families, the families become more well-adjusted, stable, and productive. This doesn't sway the PTA, however, who are more interested in bringing about the death of their hated rival. After an assassination attempt using a bomb is thwarted, the situation escalates into a full-scale war between the Dad Council and the PTA, with the world's moms and kids caught in the middle. 

Desperate to de-escalate the situation, a group of moms organize a meeting between the leaders of the two factions, with the hope that they can come to an understanding. The meeting ends with the two leaders agreeing to a ""peace walk"" where they will leave the safety of their supporters and meet in the middle, unarmed, for a peaceful conversation. Unfortunately, the PTA's leader, a bitter and misguided father named Henry Tuttle, aka the Worst Dad has other plans. After the peace walk begins, Henry and his PTA cronies ambush their rival Best Dad. Henry is killed in the struggle, but the Best Dad is also mortally wounded.

As he lies in intensive care, the members of the Dad Council begin bickering amongst themselves, leading to a power struggle for control of the Dad Council. In the ensuing chaos, they neglect their families and all their Dad rankings, as revealed by the mugs, drop precipitously.

That way they know where to turn in the case of any sudden major unexpected events. It would be bad to be lost in a time of turmoil or chaos.

In my opinion, there is no way that student athletes should be paid on these campuses, at the college level. I mean, they do get a scholarship for their athletic ability, and some even get a partial scholarship because of their grades. If they weren't getting scholarships, I'd definitely be all for paying them. Of course, they'd have to figure out how much they'd be paid. Do college athletes realize that they are essentially being paid over $350,000 to play on their teams, because the value of the scholarships will pay tuition for four years, room fees, and food every day? It just shocks me that these students don't appreciate their scholarships, because many people would die just for a chance at getting a scholarship by the age of 18.

I come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, and I've seen the struggles they have gone through to make sure their children get an education. I mean, my mom is about to get her third job, in order to give the kids in our family an opportunity to go college, when she has already done her fair share by having two jobs on top of all her responsibilities at home. I have a lot of respect for her when it comes to what she has to do in order to put us through school, and it hurts me that college athletes aren't grateful for the opportunities they've been given. No, they don't get paid for all of their hard work they put in daily, but their scholarship covers it. And if they want to give up their scholarships they'll have to pay for their own education just like the rest of us do. Would they rather have that or a scholarship? They just can't have their cake and eat it too. That wouldn't be fair to the rest of us who can't afford college and still have to pay for it on our own.

I'm not sure how persuasive I find Mr. McDavis' argument for his side of the debate. He seems more concerned about the distortion of the economics of college sports. To me, that sidesteps the real point at issue, which is the inequity of providing something like $350,000 to a bunch of teenagers that don't even understand the real value of that money. I mean, I couldn't care less if some colleges have to go into a bidding war over a few studs, and I couldn't care less if a bunch of other colleges have to scramble financially to keep up. I just don't think it's right for these kids to make that much money by playing sports, which is something they do for fun during their free time.

I have an acquaintance who vehemently disagrees with me on this issue. Her name is Soeurette and she's a women's lacrosse player at St. Lawrence University. She believes that athletes should be paid for their time on the varsity team. She points to the huge commitment that college athletes make in terms of their time and social lives. Even though I understand that perspective I note that Soeurette is one of the last people who should be advocating for pay to play, because she's the daughter of a successful businessman from France, who makes more money in a year than most Americans make in a lifetime.

In conclusion, I am not at all persuaded by the position that college athletes should be paid.",34,9,2,1,22,30,25,5,0,25,0.029411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.6764705882352942,0.42575558475689884

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, its white men in power that make me cringe. It is always a white man who is president, controls armies or are highly successful business men. Very rarely do you see a women, African American or especially any other race in the top spot in entertainment. Not only does this perpetuate the stereotype that white people still rule, it does not allow audiences to see other kinds of people in power. When that is seen in entertainment it usually becomes more acceptable and common place in the real world. This is not to say that white men should not play important roles in entertainment; it is more to show that women, African Americans and other races are just as worthy and capable of doing it too. People look up to leading characters from childhood on so it is important for them to see different kinds of people in all different positions. Because of this It is imperative that Hollywood and the entertainment industry start to change their perspective on what makes a good leading character. The country is becoming more diverse so the entertainment industry needs to do the same. If not, people will feel like Hollywood is not representing them and seek other entertainment outlets. If Hollywood wants to stay in business it needs to move away from stereotypes and embrace film making that appeals to all groups. So by reducing the white male dominated main characters, you will be inspiring old and new viewers alike to accept different people in leading roles which will ultimately translate over into the real world.

---

In my opinion,  there are many important things that students should learn in school.  However students need to come out of school with at least the basics, certainly Math and English skills, read and writing.  These simple skills, if properly taught, will serve all students through their working life and beyond.  Employers and colleges will recognize and reward the basics taught in school.  With the foundations in place students can pursue whatever they want, further education, or a career.  At times, too much energy is expended in schools in teaching skills that are too abstract from our real lives, and they serve little purpose, other than for the teacher to lead the class.  I believe that teachers should emphasize the essentials, instead of tossing in everything except the kitchen sink. If students want more, then they will have the opportunity to seek this out for themselves, and with the basic skills in hand, taught to a high level, they can go where ever they want.  For these reasons, I believe that Math and English are the most important things that students should learn in school, yes there are other things, but these two must take priority.",15,6,5,1,3,11,4,7,1,3,0.06666666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.26666666666666666,0.5753968253968254

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I believe that all people should be knowledgeable in their country and community.  As citizens we are expected to vote on a regular basis, for the people that will lead us, on a national, state and local level.  When we vote we should be well informed about the issues that candidates stand for and we should be able to make well informed choices.  So I believe that we are bad citizens if we do not keep up with what is going on in the world.  In addition, it can lead to bad consequences, where we end up with populist leaders, who are interested in appearance and not substance.  We should not tolerate that in a functioning democratic society.  It is even dangerous for the continuation of our democracy.  To be good citizen we have to be aware of what is happening where we live, in our country and in all other corners of the world.  In addition, we should be part of a society that is active and makes its voice heard on political issues to get them addressed properly.  Without knowledge we are unable to watch over what is done in our name, with our leaders acting with impunity. Democracy is not just about elections; it is about being aware, participating in discourse, and holding our leaders accountable for their actions or in actions that they undertake.  So, in conclusion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news, as we are not fulfilling our duty as citizens.

As it turns out, those lengths are pretty short. In fact, humanity doesn't really care about Matt Damon. They think he's terrible at acting and there are plenty of other people in Hollywood who can do that job better. In fact, life on Earth goes on pretty well without Matt Damon. It seems that his conspicuous lifestyle was not beneficial to the environment. After his kidnapping, scientists find out that carbon emissions have gone down significantly, and they've got the absence of Matt Damon to thank for that.

Global warming has been reversed, and humanity can worry about other pressing matters, like whether or not Bill Cosby will be running for president. That's one of the less pressing ones though, humanity turns its mind to ending war, hunger, and poverty. The nations of the world put aside their differences, and the U.S., China, Russia, the EU, and the UN, as well as the World Health Organization work together to find a cure for all diseases.

Soon, the Earth is a utopian society. And humanity has Matt Damon to thank for it. Or more properly, his absence. They consider locating his abductors to thank them, but decide that curing cancer and ascending to the next phase of human evolution is more important.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, dating apps dramatically improve the dating experience. I have used several of them, to varying degrees of success. My measure of success is whether or not I had an enjoyable experience, and more often than not, I have. 
I think dating apps are great because they allow you to meet people who you would not normally meet.
 In a typical day, I don't get much opportunity to meet new people. Time is usually accounted for, and I don't have enough free time to spend at typical hook up spots. Dating apps allow me to meet people who I would not otherwise meet, and it's a great way to get out of my comfort zone.

Technology makes dating better, outside of the dating app world as well. Apps like Netflix and having the freedom to text rather than a voice call help to keep the pressure fairly low and give me the opportunity to keep the lines of communication open. I've done virtual dates using Netflix, where we both queued up a movie at the same time, at remote locations. It was a lot of fun. 
I think technology has the potential to make dating better, but it also has the potential to make it worse.
 It can be hard to judge if there will be chemistry between two people until they have met, in person. I've had a few uncomfortable experiences, where the date was just not enjoyable for either of us. We just didn't click. I think that's a risk you take with any dating experience, but I think it's a risk worth taking.

I think that a lot of people have already used dating apps. I'm quite sure that a lot more people will utilize them in the future. They are convenient, exciting and efficient. Even when dates don't work out, the experience is still an adventure. Even if it doesn't blossom into a romantic encounter, meeting new people is usually a growth experience.

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, student athletes should absolutely get paid and a scholarship is not enough of a payment. The student athletes make the universities that they play for a ridiculous amount of money. We're talking about billions of dollars. 

The students are risking injury and in some cases even their life and if they're not compensated monetarily, that is very unfair. Think about big time football schools like Alabama and Clemson. The amount of money that they make off the student athletes is jaw dropping. 

The scholarship argument is a broken one because these athletes are doing much more work and putting in much more hours than the typical student. They are basically working as a full time student and a full time athlete. Maybe people don't understand the amount of time and effort that these kids put in to both tasks. I think that most of the people who don't want the student athletes to get paid are those who benefit from those students.

Obviously people don't want money coming out of their pockets and going to the kids. The heads of universities and the people who exploit those kids want the money all for themselves. 

To me, that is a disgusting practice. There is enough money to go around for everyone. Imagine being an athlete like Lebron James in college and not being able to make money off of your own name and likeness.

The scholarship argument doesn't hold weight. Non-monetary perks don't hold weight. The only difficult I can think of regarding students getting paid is them not knowing how to manage their money. A simple solution to that is to have the money held up in a bank account until they graduate or are drafted to a professional sports league. You can even put a caveat in where they have to maintain a specific GPA average or else they get fined. That would be motivation enough for them to better their academics.

Now, with the aliens on the brink of victory, the last hope for humanity is to try again.
 The adults still seemed weak - the best they could manage were small things - lighting fires, creating small bursts of ice and the like. Occasionally useful for escaping the aliens, but not good enough to be weapons against their tech.  
The children, however, seemed to be far more powerful.
 No one was sure why, though there were many theories. But, to be blunt, there was no time for testing theories or even questioning the facts. Children could use mana better, and were stronger, and that was going to have to be enough. 
The children were trained to use their magic, and they were trained hard.
 Captain Duran didn't like it much. ""Commander, we don't even know how to train these kids. They are experimenting with it as best they can and growing far stronger far faster than we could have imagined. But we don't know what the consequences will be.""

The plan was simple.
 The aliens' one weakness was that they were all linked to each other. And specifically they were all connected to what seemed like a literal mother ship. They protected it, shielded it, and guarded it with far more resources than was necessary. Even at the beginning, when humans were at their strongest they couldn't get close. It had to be the key. Destroy the ship and the aliens would be crippled. 

At least that was what Commander Goran was counting on, praying for, begging to be true. And so they brought every child who could control mana at all as close as they could get. And the assault began.  

At the end of the day the Commander wasn't sure if it had gone well or not. The children attacked, and it seemed that the aliens realized the danger. Suddenly, using what was apparently transporter technology all of the aliens on the planet returned to the ship and boarded, some falling to the children's power as they went. And then the ship just...left. It took off and returned to space as far as anyone could tell.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, most stereotypical characters don't really make me cringe because I understand it's a movie or a TV show. Murder is offensive and wrong but when I watch a movie or television show I understand that it is just that...a movie or show.

I understand why some would get offended over stereotypical characters though. At the end of the day stereotypes are wrong and offensive. They perpetuate traits and characteristics that are way too general of a specific race, religion, etc. 

At the end of the day, Tony Soprano was a stereotype. He is one of the most beloved characters in TV history. Even by Italians who could be offended by his character. Italians loved Tony Soprano and the show in general.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in. For example, during the slavery era there are tons of people depicted racist white people. That is a stereotype as not every single white person was a racist back then. 

These stereotypes can also be used as a learning tool. Movies about slavery teach children why it was so horrific and why being racist is bad. Stereotypes are tricky for me when it comes to films and television. Things that would offend me in real life don't offend me in movies and television. I guess that I am just able to separate real life and movies/television. Maybe I don't buy in enough and lose myself in the media.

At the end of the day, stereotypes suck and the people who perpetuate them do as well.A",22,4,17,0,1,2,1,1,0,1,0.0,0.7727272727272727,0.045454545454545456,0.5079365079365079

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.
The benefits of screen time are many.
 In terms of education for our children, the use of computers and zoom and programming geared towards kids was the only thing for many schools that allowed them to teach at all the 2020-2021 school year. Without technology and computer use, millions of children would have had absolutely no way to be in contact with their teachers and get even a semblance of learning. The use of zoom classroom allowed teachers to visually see their students and for the kids in the classes to interact with their educator and each other.

Another advantage, speaking again in terms of children, that I have noticed is when my kids are playing multiplayer games online. The ones I am most familiar with are Roblox and Overwatch.  My children have made friends from all around the world while playing these games. One always has to be vigilant for online predators, and to educate children about being safe online, but the knowledge of other cultures and other countries my children have gained with communicating with youngsters from varied areas is immeasurable. For youth to be able to interact with diverse people in a situation where you have to help each other to survive, can't really be taught in life outside a gaming situation. 

 have also noticed that my children are much more comfortable with technology than I was at their agee. I could barely figure out how to turn a computer on when I was 12, let alone program or do research. I have to ask my 12 year old for help with word sometimes, and my older teen with power point. With the world and employment becoming increasingly digital and online, it is beneficial beyond words for children to know how to interact and use technology to their advantage.
I also believe that the benefits of screen time are not just for children.
 These are just the advantages I am most tuned in to since I interact and see my children using their devices daily. There may be some disadvantages, if you allow excess screen time or don't teach your child simple online safety rules, but the benefits simply outweigh the risks. 
I am not advocating for a screen free life.
 As with anything in this life, moderation and discipline are key. This actually another benefit. Teaching children how to limit their time, and how to apply restraints to online use can also teach structure and scheduling and organization to youth before they get out into the 'real world.' The advantages are obvious to me and technology should be embraced and utilized as the tool it is.",27,6,17,0,4,9,5,4,1,4,0.0,0.6296296296296297,0.14814814814814814,0.4934086629001883

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing a student can learn in school, is a love of books and reading. Most curricula that teach reading use texts that are formal, constrained and infinitely boring. The books are written in a way that makes it difficult for the student to understand what is being said because what it contains have little to do with the students' world.

Teachers need to evaluate that world and acquire texts that describe and celebrate it. The students will then be able to read and understand what they are reading. A girl in East Harlem can read magazines and books that celebrate black and brown culture and heritage. A boy in Kansas can read books about farming, mechanics or outer space--whatever interests them.

Teaching reading using a canon of approves texts is like teach a toddler how to eat by giving them spinach and raw carrots: it may work, but does not ignite either the passions or the imagination.  Students need to be allowed to read what they want, be it comic books, science fiction, whodunits or fashion magazines. And never mind if it is on a screen or on a page.

Schools need to develop the habit of reading, never mind its object. Graduating students need to learn that when they are bored, or have a problem, or want to learn about something, the way to do that is to read about it.

Once a student has that habit, the whole world is theirs and a lifetime of learning can begin.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid with nominal monetary compensation. The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry that generates millions of dollars in revenue. The athletes are the ones who generate this revenue, and they should be compensated for their efforts. They put in lots of extra time to do the sports and some of them may come from poor families. They deserve to be paid.  On one hand, they can be properly recognized and on the other hand, poor families can be subsidized. 

I suggest a fair nominal amount should be paid to the athletes as a kind of incentive. That amount should be less than the monetary reward paid to professional athletes. In this way, colleges would not be caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford. The economics of college sports would not be distorted due to the amount being paid is only nominal but not competitive. And some poor families can be subsidized for the related costs of playing the sports. 

As a conclusion, college athletes should be paid with nominal monetary compensation.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. What is the nature of this power? And what is its purpose? Is it a blessing, or a curse?

The first stirrings of its presence are felt in the small town of Little Haven,  a place where a handful of survivors huddle together, hoping to escape the notice of the alien attackers.  It manifests itself with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, a man who appears to be human but who possesses powers far beyond those of any human mage. He begins to guide the survivors in the practice of magic, which has begun to manifest in some of them as a result of the aliens' attack, and the resulting diminishment in the human population. Before long , the survivors begin to believe that their only hope for survival lies in the mastery of magic.

Under the leadership of the mysterious stranger, the survivors begin to explore the nature of the power they possess, and the means by which they can use it to defend themselves against the alien invaders. They defend the town against a small alien attack, wielding magic as a weapon for the first time. Before long, they have begun to launch small counterattacks against the aliens with increasing degrees of success.

However, they notice something disturbing. The more magic they use, the more the world around them seems to change. The trees, the animals, are becoming altered in not-so-subtle ways into things they can't recognize. One of the villagers, Jonas, begins to notice that his wife is changing, as well. She's become mercurial, speaking in a language that's impossible for him to understand at times, though the stranger seems to understand her perfectly.

Jonas confronts the stranger, demanding to know what's happening to his wife. The stranger explains that the magic they're using is causing a fundamental change in the nature of the world, and that it's a change that will affect them all. He reveals that he is not a human, but an alien, and that his people have been using magic for thousands of years. He tells Jonas that long ago, they used magic to transform themselves into beings that could lave their planet, which was dying. He had landed on earth eons ago, and had dominated the development of early man, but as the mana faded, he had been forced to retreat into a form of hibernation.

Jonas is uneasy about what these changes will entail, and what the future for humanity will be, but the stranger points to his wife. 'Would you rather know her as this, and she know you as you will become?' He then points to the graveyard. 'Or is this your preference?' Jonas goes away, and spend the night in thought.

The next day, he has decided not to inform the other townsfolk about what he knows. They grow stronger, and lead the growing rebellion against the alien conquerors. Before long, it is clear that they will eventually win this war.

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices.  he benefits of screen time are many and include:
 cnnecting with family and friends
, while at the same time, reducing the risk of transmitting the virus; staying informed about the latest news and developments; and managing our work, and bills, from the comfort of home. By doing this, we are not only protecting ourselves,  and helping to protect others, we are saving time, and money, and reducing the stress of being in a crowded public space.

Things like computers and the internet were invented for a reason. They are intended to make our lives easier, and more productive, and the current situation is a perfect opportunity for them to shine in their intended role. If not now, when exactly would this level of screen time be both necessary, and desirable? The current situation will pass, and when it does, we can return to business as usual, while knowing  we did what we could in trying times, and we will all be better off for having embraced the benefits of our digital devices.

They will say that online interactions are not the same as in person interactions, and that they are not as meaningful. This is true, they are less meaningful, but they are better than isolation.  They will say in person work, and learning, allow for things that online work and learning don't. This is perhaps also true, but that is a false dichotomy. In many cases, the choice here is not between online and in-person, it is between online and nothing at all. Critics also tend to ignore the fact that by embracing screen time, we are also helping to save unknown numbers of lives.

""This is an act of war!"" The current US President, Thomas Fitzpatrick, declared. ""I demand that the rest of the world surrender to us, or we will use our overwhelming military superiority to force them into submission!"" he angrily continued.

While it was true that none of the other counties have isolated for the past 50 years, they have done so because of the sole reason that the United States was so heavily militarized and so close to outright dictatorship that they felt it was in their best interest. The mastermind of the whole thing was a man named Johnathan Wright. He was an American but was living in the United Kingdom and chose that country as his base of operations. He has notified every single country on earth to not isolate, but did not tell the United States.

During the first year of the United States isolation, Mr. Wright has made a press conference that aired globally (except the United States, of course) and he addressed the world saying, ""I want to address the world because I cannot stand by and allow this to happen, and I know a lot of you agree.""

So in the end, Wright's prediction did actually come true. The United States did not turn into a dictatorship superpower ruler of the world, and the world got an excuse to rebuild and reorganize their governments in a way that would prevent something like this from happening again. There were significantly less wars, and more organizations were formed to ensure that global peace was maintained.

The world moved on and everyone actually had a pretty good time. The earth slowly healed and pollution rates went down significantly. Climate change was no longer a threat because most of the planet was cooled down to temperatures that were not harmful to human life. Researchers have gathered data and found out that the planet was returning to a time before man walked on Earth. This was all conveyed peacefully to President Fitzpatrick. 

""If this is the way the world wants to go, so be it,"" He said reluctantly, admitting to the horrors and to the damages his country made in the past millennia's. He then made a declaration of his own and ordered the US military to stop all military action and focus on helping the world rebuild. He ordered to also get rid of all nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and to destroy any of them that were still in the hands of the US military.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are a very different experience than reading, with unique advantages and disadvantages. I have listened to them on occasion, and they fill a different role in my life than reading does, and I can't see myself ever giving up either one.

One of the benefits of audiobooks is that they are a great way to consume books while doing something else. You can work, drive, cook, exercise, do chores or any number of things while listening to a book. Another advantage of audiobooks is that they are in many ways, easier and less effortful than reading, so they're a great way to continue consuming books when you don't have the time or energy to read. Reading a book requires a certain level of concentration and focus, while an audiobook is as simple to do as clicking 'play.' Audiobooks also offer the situational advantage of being read by a professional narrator, which can make the experience of listening to a book more enjoyable than reading it. This of course depends on the skill of the narration, and whether or not you enjoy the narrator's voice. One completely unique advantage of audiobooks, is that they can simulate the experience of being read a bedtime story, and give you the chance to be read off into a soothing night's rest.

On the other hand, books have several advantages of their own. They provide a a much more immersive experience than audiobooks. There's something about the act of reading a book, consciously, that can makes you feel like you're in the story, and that's something that audiobooks can't provide. Books can be more vivid, and can provide a greater sense of depth and detail than audiobooks. There are no limitations of the environment or pacing or the author's voice, and everything is created by the reader's imagination. Books can also be read at one's own pace, which is impossible with audiobooks. It can be very frustrating to be eagerly awaiting the next event in a book, and then have to wait for the narrator to finish a sentence, a paragraph, or a chapter. 

In closing, audiobooks aren't a replacement for books, and they aren't really better or worse. Instead, they're a different way of consuming books, and they fill a different role in one's life than reading does. Overall they're an advantage, since they allow a lover of books to consume books in ways and in situations where reading might be difficult or impossible.",26,7,4,1,14,24,17,7,0,17,0.038461538461538464,0.15384615384615385,0.5769230769230769,0.4372384937238494

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Athletes are the ones generating all of the money and attention for their colleges. They are the ones that are putting in the extra hard work and dedication to their sport. They are putting their bodies on the line to play a sport they love.

Athletes are unique in that they are risking their bodies for the sake of their sport. No other career path has as many risks in college. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their school. They are risking their bodies for the sake of their fans. One wrong twist or turn, one concussion and their lives could change forever.  Their risk is unique among college students, and should be compensated as such. 

College sports programs are key moneymakers for most schools. The money that the college makes from the sports program is used to fund other programs. As they contribute, athletes should share in the profits. 
Athletes are not getting paid for their work.
 There are many tournaments, representative qualifying events that occur on the weekend. These events are not paid for.  The athletes promote the school, and should be allowed to reap some of the benefits, even in if small monetary amounts. 

Let's be realistic. Some of these people are at the peak of their physical lives. in college. They will never be healthier or more attractive. They are young, fit, and have the world at their fingertips.   Some people rely on the brains to make their way through life. Some people rely on their physical attributes.  They are legal adults, and there is no better chance for them to secure their financial future.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

With any type of sport, the participant naturally accepts or understands the possibility of injury and any other negative outcomes that may come from participating in said sport. For extreme mountain climbing, or any other type of extreme sport, the participant has to be still aware of the high risks involved, and accept them to a certain degree. For the most part, a grand majority of the population would steer clear of extreme sports, viewing the risks of the sports to be too high to be worthwhile, or the benefits too low to accept such risks. owever, there are sthe notable fewwho are wnot only illing to accept the risks of extreme sports, abua also tke them to a higher level.
 These are the people that know what they are willing to risk, and are also willing to put in the effort and time to meet the demands of such sport, potentially even surpassing the records and achievements of past athletes.
The risks of extreme sports are not only physical, but also mental.
 Thus, many have different considerations to make when deciding if a sport is reasonable or unreasonable to pursue. For that reason, I believe it is quite difficult to set a known standard for what makes a sport reasonable, that can essentially be applied to the everyone. For example, a person may be willing to risk their time and efforts for a less dangerous sport, but not willing to risk their health in terms of any injuries or debilitation they might sustain from participating in the sport. While one person might view a normal sport as too risky to play, another might view it as not risky enough to motivate them to participate in, nor to motivate them to improve their own abilities. n my opinion, it is not the sport itself tand hheir risks tat makes it unreasonable, but rather the person's willingness to accept the risks involved.
 Ultimately, there are a variety of people with different interests, abilities, and mindsets that affects how they view sports. A sport cannot be called too dangerous to be called a sport, as there always will exist the possibility that someone will rise up to the challenges of the sport, and set off to make notable accomplishments in the sport despite any risks that exist.

In any case, many high risk sports are likely to be viewed as unreasonable by those who prefer more traditional sports. That isn't to say some will view it as feasbile or impractical to pursue, but most will understand the dangers and steer clear based on their own vocation. Those sports will continue to remain sports even if many view them as too dangerous or risky, as it will still have participants willing to work towards meeting their demands and overcoming its risks, to make amazing feats and achievements based on physical and mental prowess.

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans are suffering. Goodwill towards living creatures can't be segmented neatly nor should it be stifled in any case. Isn't the premium we place on human life over animal life a clearly biased stance?  believe that we should be empathetic towards all living creatures.
 Care of one type of lifeform will only increase the value that we put on all life in general. This is not a case of a well with limited water but of a capacity for love that can only be strengthened through use. Therefore, we should commend people for caring for animals. It's important to remember that many animals that now exist were basically created, in their current form, by humans. Thus we have a responsibility for their wellbeing. Further it shouldn't surprise us that humans care for animals so readily. We are animals ourselves. And in some ways animals embody the most innocent aspects of our own nature. If humans stopped caring for animals we would not compensate by caring more for other people. On the contrary, our overall empathy would decline dangerously.

In my opinion, it is not a selfish endeavor to pursue extreme and dangerous sports. In fact, it is human nature to test the limits of personal potential and to push the boundaries of what is possible in the physical world. Some people get such high satisfaction from these activities that it is the focus of their lives. It is also true that many people say that the ability to be present or engaging with the ""here and now"" is greatly enhanced by more dangerous sports like mountain climbing since it becomes primary when doing these sports. This is not so much of a selfish endeavor as it is one of personal learning and growth. 

There are risks involved with dangerous sports in nature, but there are also many risks in other sport activities. I believe anyone should be able to choose the sport they like to participate in, whether it be dangerous or not. It's dangerous to drive a car on the freeway, but we don't all stay home, because that is no way to live. 

I suppose in rare instances a line should be drawn. For example, if the person is the head of their household and is responsible for the care of people, then the activities with the most risk should maybe be avoided. However, this is still an issue that should be left up to the individual. 

No sport, in my opinion is too dangerous to be called a sport. The inherent risk in any sport ultimately lays on the shoulders of the individual who chooses to play that sport, and no one else. In conclusion, I don't think risky sports are selfish and avoiding them or not should be left to the choice of the individual who can decide for themselves if they are too dangerous.",18,5,9,0,4,5,4,1,0,4,0.0,0.5,0.2222222222222222,0.49340369393139843

In my opinion, technology is a detriment to dating.   Due to dating apps, people have forgotten how to interact with people in real life.    They are no longer able to read body language, facial expression, or tone of voice.   People have lost the ability to identify when someone is attracted to you.

In my opinion, there are sports that are so extreme they are too dangerous to be called a sport.  They should not be encouraged, indeed, some should be banned.  

There has to be a measure between the benefit received and the risk taken.  The benefits can be in the form of personal gratification, the advancement of the skills acquired that advance society, the advancement of knowledge, etc.  The risks can be in the form of costs to society to give medical treatment or sustain life after an accident, the loss of life, etc.  If the benefits are not worth the risks, then the sport should be banned.

Just as the government has mandated the use of seatbelts, helmets for motorcycle riding, and outlawing the scaling of urban buildings they can and should step in to regulate extreme sports.  They should also make certain the media, once these are banned, does not report and glorify the participants.  

There will always be people who are too ignorant and foolish to follow the mandates and we should try to ensure that those unfortunate few do not encourage others to follow in their footsteps.  In my opinion, the Tide Pods craze, where people ate them is a perfect example of media contributing to the problem.",14,5,8,0,1,5,1,4,1,0,0.0,0.5714285714285714,0.07142857142857142,0.5563380281690141

One day, she receives an email from someone new. Since she has a lot of time on her hands, she decides to meet him for coffee. The last guy stopped answering her calls, and she was hopeful. 
When she arrives to the coffee shop, her date already has a cup in front of him.
 She walks over to the table. 
""This is for you."" he says, pointing at the cup.
  ""What about you?"" she asks. ""Don't you want a drink too?"" 
""Oh, I don't need one."" he replies.
 ""I just had one last week."" ""That's odd,"" she thought. She tried to think of something to say. 
""Oh, so do you come here often?"" she asks.
 
""I come here every week."" he replies.
 She was confused. 

""I thought you said you just had a drink here last week."" she says. She was wondering if she should leave. 
""I did."" he says.
 At this point, it didn't matter. She was ready to go. 
""Well, I gotta run.

""Wait.

She was confused. ""But we only just met. What do you mean, one more shot?"" 
He sat back down.
 ""It's me""  

She looked at him once more and shook her head. ""You have me mistaken for someone else,"" she said. ""I don't even know who you are."" 

Just then, in the blink of an eye, he transformed. She was so shocked, she couldn't move. Sitting in front of her was the last guy she dated. The one that stopped calling her back. 
He looked at her and said, ""I'm sorry.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The 92nd little pig, Frank, said ""Yeah, I know, not a great idea. But I have 91 older brothers and sisters. It seems like they have tried everything possible to make their fortune. What am I supposed to do?""
The wolf said ""Well, you could try making a house out of something that is not radioactive.""


Frank sighed. ""You're right I'll demolish this one and just build a regular house I guess. But I still need to find a way to make my fortune!""
The wolf said ""Well, I have an idea.
 You could build a house out of something that is not radioactive and then you could sell it to people who are not radioactive.""

Frank looked at him, a little irritated. ""You have to be joking, right? You know my three oldest brothers have the most successful house building company in town. One is the architect, one does the manual labor, and the other does security. There's no way I could make my fortune with them in town.""

And the wolf said, ""Exactly."" 
Frank said ""What do you mean, 'Exactly'?""


""There's no way you can be successful in _this_ town. You guys do know there is a whole world out there, right?""
Frank said ""Yeah, I know, but there's no way I could get to the other side of the world.
""

The wolf stared at the little pig. ""Now you're joking, right?"" Frank looked at him, a little confused and not at all joking. ""You're not joking. Ok, I don't know what your mom has told you, or what fairy tale books you have been reading. But you don't need to go to ""the other side of the world."" There's another town 10 miles to the north, and another 7 miles southeast. And dozens of others in a 150 mile radius.""
Frank looked at the wolf, still a little confused.
 The wolf decided to take pity on him. It was his fault the pigs' mom was so paranoid that she hadn't told her kids about the wider world.
""Ok, look, I'll show you.
 Go pack up - sell anything you can't carry. And don't forget to demolish that depleted uranium house too.""
Frank went home and packed up his stuff.
 He met the wolf on the road, and they headed off to the nearest town. Frank was amazed when they got there. Not by the people, or how wonderful the town was. But by the houses. 

They were terrible. Worse than his eldest brother's original straw house. 

""See, I told you."" said the wolf.

And with that Frank's fortune was made. He started up a construction company specializing in houses, and soon he was known as the best builder in the kingdom. 
And that's how Frank became the third richest pig in the world.

This is a shock to the world since nothing like this has ever happened before. Dad's around the world were just confused at first with some a little more worried about their number then others. Reports started to come out around the world that these rankings might have some truth behind them. The United Nations is now involved in trying to figure out what exactly is going on. They released a report showing a correlation between criminal offenses and lower dad rankings. That was then compounded by divorce and remarried statuses. The big one though seemed to be that medical information was incorporated into the rankings. Dad's with psychological disorders were being ranked lower then their more normal counterparts. Intelligence agencies around the world were saying this is the biggest security breach of online personal information in history. The way the cups changed though was still a mystery.  he following two weeks showed that the rankings were accurate.
 This was devastating to a majority of dad's around the world who were not ranked in the top 90%. A new system of credit and social perks started to become available to top ranking dads. All the women wanted them, they turned into celebrities over night while the lower ranking dads saw their quality of life either diminish or completely collapse. This lead to an increase in divorce and social isolation for a lot of low ranking dads and eventually banishment to their own country were they lived the rest of their lives without women and children. The top remaining dads implemented laws that allowed for monogamy and they populated the world with the genes of the top ranking dad's. This eventually backfired as the gene pool was not diverse enough and humanity devolved into their more chimp like cousins.

In my opinion, I think that if college athletes are paid, the spirit of sports might be ruined. If college athletes are paid, they will be more concerned about the money than the game or the team.  Also, if college athletes are paid, they will be more likely to cheat. Fairness of the game is therefore jeopardized. In addition, if college athletes are paid, they will be more likely to leave school early. College athletes are supposed to be students, not professional players. Their first priority should be the academic performance. Being paid to pay sports will distract the students from focusing on their academic, thus ruining the ultimate purpose of attending college. Providing monetary compensation to players gives them a false interpretation that sports are linked to monetary compensation. The meaning of sportsmanship would thus be lost. Due to these downsides in providing monetary compensation to players, I think that athletes should not be paid monetary compensation.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people aren't bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but I do think that for me personally, there is a sense of civic duty where keeping up with current events is concerned. If somebody doesn't care what is going on or doesn't want to know, that's fine. But I think as a citizen, it's worthwhile to try and occasionally be informed. 

I don't know that any one person can actually do anything to change the larger social issues, but I think it's worthwhile as a way to participate. If you have a chance to speak up about political issues at work, or at school, or locally, I think you should. 
f you don't, though, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 

I think the things that are happening far away shouldn't bind anybody to feel like they're a bad person if they aren't actively talking or writing about a political issue or community they aren't directly involved in. If you have a choice, sure, the world could use another person with an opinion and a chance to write something for the internet, but it's not like you're doing anything wrong by caring more about the local community, or work, or family, or friends. 

o you think that the things that are happening in the news are actually affecting your life or this society in any significant way?
 Do you think if you keep up with the news and get involved in politics you can make any real difference? Does this type of awareness effect your life at all in a positive or negative way? The answers are different for each person. 

My life is being impacted by the fact that our president just spewed overtly racist statements about immigrants. Someone threw rocks threw rocks at the car next to mine with political stickers telling immigrants to go back home. I ended up paying $300 to fix the collateral damage. Our society is impacted by this and will be even more so as the news travels around the world. 

Can I make any real difference? Probably not. I can have my opinions and hopes and dreams, but I likely can't do anything that will effectively change policy in any substantial way. 
What I can do is do things to help me feel like I'm an active participant in the world.
 I talk to strangers when I'm out in public instead of sitting at my table and being an introvert. I try to stay informed about local and state politics. I try to make safe spaces for people of various backgrounds and try to speak up when I see bigotry. 
I know I can't make any real change and that the world is big and scary and overwhelming, but I like feeling like my words
 and actions are at least a small part of the picture. I feel that I can make a change at local level, and pay attention to the news I see involving my community. But I don't judge those who feel differently. They're not bad, just have a different perspective than I do. ",32,6,5,0,21,29,26,3,9,17,0.0,0.15625,0.65625,0.4026186579378069

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading it and maybe even better. Everyone has their own preference, however i like being able to listen to a book because it allows me to do other things while i listen. When you are physically reading a book, you cannot really multitask. When you have four kids, two dogs, and a wife you are really just trying to be as efficient as you can throughout the day. Being able to plug in and hear a nice book while doing house work or walking the dogs is great! I feel i am able to improve myself as a person without stressing myself out over loosing time for tasks. Not only this, but it has given me a full library of books to choose from that i would need to physically go to the library to have access to. Another reason i personally prefer audiobooks is the fact that the titles are cheaper to buy on the audiobook platform than they are to buy physical copies for. This is a no brainer since it costs to print the actual book. So to me, it is really all pros when it comes to audiobooks, and they fit into my life like a puzzle piece. If you have a busy lifestyle and still want to be able to continue learning i really think audiobooks are the way to go. There are no real disadvantages for me personally. This being said i understand the perspective of someone who would prefer physically reading a book. Being able to immerse yourself in the book in complete silence is a very therapeutic experience. This alone by itself may be something that helps enhances someone's calm and i understand that. Not everyone likes to multi task all the time, and for some people reading is just something that allows them to get their minds off of things and focus on one thing. I have had my moments like this, and for this situation maybe reading is the way to go, or even using an audiobook and just closing your eyes. I am a very overactive person, so the thought of not being productive can stress me out. This is why i like using the audiobooks when i am doing other things. I feel i get more of the book when i listen when going for a drive or for a run. If you are pushing yourself during a run sometimes all you want to think about is the book to not think about how you are running up this gigantic hill and you have more hills to go. Sure you can listen to any music, but there is something about listening to a book that all ties into one intricate picture in my head when i run. Its like the feeling of being completely immersed in a movie. Add the runners high to this and you feel like a million bucks.",30,7,21,0,2,2,2,0,0,2,0.0,0.7,0.06666666666666667,0.43933823529411764

In my opinion, I think college students should not be paid for playing sports. I believe that college athletes should be paid in the form of a scholarship. I think it is inegalitarian to pay college athletes because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Everyone deserves reward and merit for their hard work. It is unfair that students that don't play sports have to struggle to pay for college while the athletes get a free ride. I also believe that sports are unsafe and it is not fair to pay college athletes because they could get seriously injured. There are students studying medical sciences and healthcare, and are trained to help injured athletes. These students are not rewarded fairly for this.  They on to live stressful lives with lots of debt, while athletes are rewarded with a free ride. This is why I believe that college athletes should not be paid.

In my opinion, the argument makes sense but there are other ways the players could get paid. They could get paid by the TV stations, promotional situations and maybe enjoy some extra non-monetary perks from Universities. As stated above, the TV networks make a killing off of these players and should at the very least help pay for higher education or other beneficial pursuits. This would probably create an elite class of players even more then now but probably not by much. They are already highly regarded and respected players who are on TV all the time, some extra money or a car here and there would not make much of a difference. It may actually encourage some players to focus more on their game and get better. I imagine there would be a few down sides, like the poorer colleges not being able to secure decent players and then it would be a cycle of bad seasons and less money. The other down side would be the elite players getting paid more and then not being as hungry to win. More money may distract those top players.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, I think technology has a great impact on dating, and not just dating but in general just meeting new people. Whether its for dating or just trying to hang out with people. I have met a lot of friends that became real life friends, by playing online video game.

As far as dating, it really helps you to put yourself out there to meet people who are looking for the same thing as you, and often times have the same interests as you. Not to mention it speeds up the process of finding a date, or a potential partner.

I do have experience with dating and technology. As a matter of fact, I met my wife through a dating website and app. I don't think we would have met otherwise. We both had the same interests and hobbies, and we were both looking for someone to share our lives with. So we found each other, dated for awhile, and ended up getting married a couple of years later. Still happy also. 

Other technology can also have a great impact on any type of relationship also. Every sit back on the couch at night with your sweet heart and just relax while watching Netflix? Yup, that's using technology in your relationship. It can also help you understand your partner better as well. Maybe you want to surprise your partner with a gift. Get out your smartphone and order it online from Amazon or something. Again, technology just made your life a little easier. 
Technology can also be a great way to keep in touch with your partner.
 Through messaging apps you can still communicate while away from each other, to let each other know you both still care.
I think technology has a great impact on dating, and relationships in general.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes by themselves are not always harmful, as they are simply a shortcut that people make when they do not have enough information about an individual.  However, even though they are not intended to be harmful, they often can be, especially to the person who is being judged.  
I cringe when I see a character that is a stereotype because it makes me feel like the author is lazy., but I also feel that this use of stereotyping might end up being harmful to the group that the author is writing about.  For example, if an author writes about black youths who end up committing crimes, this would further strengthen society's expectations that young black males are violent, and this will lead others not to trust them.  Clearly, this is not right, because crime comes from poverty, not from race.  
I wwas fortunate in life to have been born a white male, which gives me definite advantages.  However, if I was a member of a minority group, I ould nprefer ot wto atch or read something that is offensive to me, because I would feel like the author is being disrespectful to me.
  I would also feel that I was rewarding this conduct on the part of authors and screenwriters, which would further encourage it.  

As a member of the majority, though, I do still cringe when I see minority groups portrayed in an insensitive, stereotypical fashion on TV, in movies, and to a lesser extent in books.  This not only harms the group as a whole, but it also affects individual actors.  When there are no roles available for minority actors except for those that perpetuate stereotypes, these actors are either left without opportunities, or they have to betray their morals in order to keep working.  

If people were more apt to reject stereotypes, these difficult decisions would not have to be made.  

Stereotypes do not always have to be negative, however.  Someone might assume that a young Asian person is smart, especially at math, or that someone who wears glasses is a good student.  They might assume that Native Americans are noble in spirit, or that elderly African Americans are devoted to family values.  These are all stereotypes that appear from time to time in fictional characters, and I have to object to them as well.

I generally do not have a severe negative reaction to these stereotypes, because I do not see any acute harm that comes from them, but they are still lazy.  One should not assume that the circumstances of one's birth have any impact on their character or their abilities.  After all, if you automatically assume that an Asian student is going to be the best in the class, aren't you also assuming that the other students are naturally inferior, because of their race?
ISo, in summary,  do not think that it is wrong to have a stereotype,.b This is something that happens automatically within our brains, and we can't really stop these thoughts from popping up.  Bt I think that it is wrong to judge someone based on a
 stereotype that either comes from within, or that we have picked up from society at large.  

Not only do stereotypes lead to negative judgments against others, which sometimes have real-world consequences, but they also prevent people from enjoying the kinds of equal opportunities that all of us deserve.  

The stereotype may be inevitable, but the prejudice that it leads to comes about by choice.  And that is a choice that no one should be making.",27,4,19,0,4,7,4,3,4,0,0.0,0.7037037037037037,0.14814814814814814,0.4519685039370079

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

In my opinion, there is no such thing as a ""too dangerous"" sport. If you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.  All sports have risk.  Studies show that chess grandmasters have elevated blood flow and higher risk of aneurysms. You can die at any time, doing anything. It's just a matter of how much risk you are willing to accept.

I think that if you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.
 If you remove the personal effort and risk, most sports would become nothing but people simultaneously exercising.  Risk has appeal, and the balancing of it with rewards is everything. 

People should be educated about the risks. If they choose to participate anyway, then that's their choice. Anything less takes away from their freedom. ",22,5,8,0,9,21,11,10,1,10,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.4090909090909091,0.5180327868852459

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we definitely aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. The news can be so stressful, even traumatizing for people if they are too plugged in to it. A lot of what's happening in the world should be left separate from our lives. Big world events are important to know, but the small things like someone getting stabbed at a convenience store, just serve to cause fear and it doesn't help society for everyone to know. Being informed of what's going on in the world politically can benefit us, but I don't believe that we need to know all of the crazy stuff. I do think it is important for people to know what's going on in regard to some things. I wouldn't want to live somewhere where I didn't know that the environment was being poisoned. I would also want to know if our country was threatened by war. Those are things that a person should never have to ignore in general. But, sometimes it's easy to learn about the important things just by talking to people. There isn't a need to follow so closely to keep up with what is going on. I don't think that everyone has a responsibility to know what is going on in the news, but I do believe that every person should feel some sort of connection to people so that they at least care about what is going on. Engaging with current events can be one way of doing this, but it isn't the only way. So in conclusion, no, I do not think we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news because there are still so many other ways to be involved, good citizens.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf was very surprised that the house had been built out of depleted uranium. Who had ever heard of such a thing? 
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm going to blow your house down.""
 But the little pig held firm. The little pig said there was no way that the wolf could blow that house down.

So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew, but the house withstood the wolf's mighty huffing and puffing
. Still, Dr. Oliver's house stayed fully intact. It was practically fulfilling a law of science. There was no way that house was coming down just with a few huffs and puffs. 
So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed.
 But the wolf's huffing and puffing was not enough to blow down the house. The wolf was very angry. He was very angry that he could not blow down that house. Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. 
The wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry.
 And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. 
Dr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this.
 So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. 
Dr. Oliver was not going to let that happen.
 He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. 
So Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, DSmith The wolf was vpleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. 
Smith had built his house out of lead.
 And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. 
The predator was a flarge ox.
 The fox spotted the wolf and gulped him down. And that was the end of the little pig's worries. He no longer needed to be concerned that anyone would ever be a threat to his brothers or sisters ever again.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, athletes should be permitted to engage in any sport they choose as long as they are educated about the risks involved and choose to take those risks upon themselves. The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death.

For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common.  A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump.  Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes.

My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned as well,  which would lead to very few sports in which an athlete could lawfully compete.",14,5,0,1,8,19,17,2,0,17,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.6428571428571429,0.5618811881188119

I feel like we need more films and books that show strong women who can take care of themselves. A strong female lead character would be such an inspiration to young girls. These kinds of stories could carry messages about self-reliance, independence and empowerment. I think if one strong female lead is a success at the box office, we will start to see more of them. There could be an entire movement of strong female characters in film and literature. This could lead to a generation of newly-empowered females. A new wave of strong feminine energy could be on the horizon, and would be a great thing for society. We could soon have more female presidents , CEOs, and other powerful positions.

The shapeshifter himself has always been very talented, and is a doctor by trade. He has decided to shape shift into a more handsome doctor, kind of like a George Clooney from ER type, because he knows she loves the show. The shapeshifter, Jim, has done his research and found out that the woman, Karen, goes to her primary care physician at the Coastal Medical institute.

Jim got a job as an Asthma specialist, and he made sure he shadowed Dr John with all of his patients so he would take over when he was on vacation. Karen happened to have an appointment the week Dr John was going to be on vacation, so that was when Jim was going to try to swoop in. 

It was the day of the appointment, and Jim was excited to set his plan in motion. He arrived at the medical center for work like any other day, but he made sure he wore his special cologne. He was going to make sure he smelled good for Karen. He walked into the office and greeted the receptionist, and then he walked into the back to get ready for his first patient. It just so happened that his first patient for the day was Karen. He was overjoyed when he saw her name at the top of the list.

He got his room ready for the day, made sure everything was perfect, and then he heard a knock on his door. He answered it and standing before him was Karen.   She was wearing a beautiful dress, and she looked absolutely stunning. Jim was taken aback, but he remained professional. He could tell that Karen was attracted to him, as she seemed somewhat shy and flustered and a little bit awkward. The appointment was going exceedingly well, but Jim had to remain professional. He did his best to slip in hints about his personal life, and that he was single.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sport are not to dangerous to be sports. Of course there needs to be some restrictions on them - mountains should be closed of the conditions are dangerous, same with surfing areas, skateparks should be inspected for structural safety, etc. But it is a personal risk which one chooses to do, and that personal choice should remain once all reasonable precautions have been taken.
But generally, sports are about testing yourself.
 All sports can result in terrible injury; think about all the recent controversies recently around concussions especially in football and soccer. And all of the terrible, literally bone shattering, injuries that happen in gymnastics. And yet we allow it, or at least don't prevent it - why? Because those sports are traditional ones, and we have long since become accustomed to the dangers of them. But most extreme sports are new, and from the comparison, seem more dangerous. 

Some people might say that the cost of these sports is passed on to others, including people with no interest in the sport. For example a rescue mission to retrieve stranded mountain climbers can costs thousands and thousands of dollar of public service and rescue worker funds, and can be dangerous for the rescue workers as well.  But the same is true in the case of a terrible traffic accident, or a construction incident, fishing boats caught in storms etc. And those are far more common, as far more people choose to drive, or work dangerous jobs. But those things are considered necessary, and so the risk is ignored. 

Finally, while extreme sports are risky, like with any activity they will become less risky over time. As more is learned about them, and more safety measures are developed, the dangers will decrease. And it would be sad to lose such exciting and enjoyable activities due to fear. 

So I say those who want to participate in extreme sports should be allowed to do so freely, as long as they understand the risks.",23,5,12,1,5,7,6,1,1,5,0.043478260869565216,0.5217391304347826,0.2608695652173913,0.547911547911548

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the pig was like, ""what wolf?"" The wolf was a little annoyed because he knew that the 92nd little pig had only built his house out of depleted uranium on the totally incorrect assumption that the wolf was going to try to blow his house down. Which didn't even make any sense, because wolfs can't blow down houses anyway. It's not in their job description. Yes, there's that whole story of the three little pigs, but that story gave wolves a bad reputation that is totally undeserved. 

So the wolf felt that he was being discriminated against, and so he called his lawyer. And his lawyer said, ""Yeah, you've got a case. I can totally win you damages."" The wolf said, ""What do you mean damages?"" And the lawyer explained, ""Well, you've got this unfair depiction of wolves out there, and it's destroying your reputation."" The wolf nodded. Finally, someone understood his plight. And he knew that his lawyer could get the job done, because his lawyer was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and regardless, his lawyer was a graduate of Yale Law School. Yes, that's right, his lawyer had even turned down an offer to work for white shoe law firm Wolf, Schmool & Schmurtz, but that's neither here nor there. The point was that this lawyer was an excellent one. 

So, the wolf got started in terms of compiling his case. And he thought about all of the ways that people had been discriminating against him in a way that was completely unfair. And he had a long list. For example, at the zoo he always got to sit in the last car of the train, and people would throw things at him, which wasn't fair. And sometimes when he went to the beach, people would put up fences so he couldn't get to the water. The wolf felt increasingly depressed thinking of all the ways that showed he was a disliked creature. He knew his lawyer would need to dazzle the judge.

On the day of the hearing, the wolf's lawyer stood before the judge and said, ""Your honor, I have here a petition for damages."" And the judge was like, ""Why does this petition say that we're here to talk about a lawsuit against the pigs?"" And the lawyer explained, ""Yes your honor, we are here to talk about a lawsuit against the pigs. My client is here to talk about the unfair portrayal of wolves in the story of the three little pigs."" ""I'm listening,"" said the judge. ""Your honor, the wolf is an upstanding citizen.

But that story is so out there that it has caused my client to suffer undue discrimination. My client is now suing for damages, which he believes is fair.""

""We weren't out to ruin your reputation, wolf."" The wolf nodded but said he still wanted his millions. 

In the end, the judge was sympathetic to the wolf's plight. The judge knew how tough a defamation case would be on the wolf's career and thought monetary damages were suitable as a remedy.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, all female students should have access to free tampons and pads via a discreet way of distribution. I think that we should be doing everything we possibly can to make our students as comfortable as humanly possible. If that means distributing pads and tampons for female students, we should do that.

I can only imagine what it would be like as a female student and forgetting to bring a pad or a tampon one day. I think we all understood that it would be embarrassing for the student to speak up or tell someone about that. I can only imagine the anxiety and stress. 

We really should set something up in schools that allow a female student to go to the nurse and receive these items for free. There shouldn't be any stress behind it. Zero embarrassment as well as the nurse was once a 16-17 year old female student as well.

When it comes to soap, paper towels and toilet paper...I really don't see much of a difference when compared to tampons and pads. They are all items that are there to help us regarding our personal hygiene. I understand that those items are only used by females but that shouldn't matter at all.

If anything we should be going above and beyond to make sure our female students are comfortable in school. School is basically a child's second home.  It is our school and our government's responsibility to ensure that our female students can get these items.

Without that in place, we're really making school a difficult place for female students to be. I'm sure most females at one point in their life have misplaced a tampon or simply forgotten to bring one.

The opportunity to play in big games, to impress future employers, and to represent their school is enough compensation for these players. ollege athletes already earn tutors, trainers, and coaching in order to be better players.
 The tutors, trainers, and coaches do not charge for their services; therefore neither should the college players. M opponent argues that the colleges should pay athletes because the colleges generate so much money.
  However, the colleges are already pampering the athletes by providing comfortable locker rooms with plush benches, nice equipment, well-tended fields and extensive libraries. In addition to these pampering amenities, the colleges also arrange for summer camps, which increase the odds of a player turning professional.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is ridiculous to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I'll go one step further, and say that it is absurd, and possibly immoral, to focus on animal welfare at all. Humans are the smartest, and most complex, beings on the planet. They are far more capable than other animals of feeling pain, and of suffering. Furthermore, humans are our own species, and we should be focusing on our own welfare, primarily relating to ourselves and those closest to us, but also to our fellow humans in general. A person who doesn't have the time, or inclination, to aid other humans might be justified if all of their efforts are going towards helping themselves.  In fact, a person might also be justified in feeling that they don't have an obligation to help other humans, and that their duty to help is owed only to themselves and their families and friends.

A person who devotes efforts to helping animals though, isn't in either of these positions.  What can their possible justification be? They're expending effort to help animals, they can't be too resource-strapped or busy, and if they aren't, they should be helping other humans before animals, yet they aren't, and I can't think of any good reason why they shouldn't be. They're being actively immoral by not helping humans, and actively immoral by helping animals. In short, they're a bad person.

I could spend a lot of time showing other reasons why a concern for animals is absurd. For starters, animals don't have rights. like humans. They aren't protected by the law, like humans. They are routinely used as sources of food, and clothing, and entertainment, and for scientific experimentation. This isn't confined to humans, either, animals do this themselves to other species to the extent that they're able. Animals don't care about the suffering of other animals, and they don't care about the suffering of humans. So animals are just doing what they should be doing, it's a few strange, overly sentimental humans that are violating the natural order of things.

I guess the question becomes, why do these people care so much about animals, in such oddly specific situations, when they don't care about other humans, or even other animal species in general? I'd suggest that the answer is, they don't really care about animals at all, they just want to feel good about themselves. So the question here about animal versus human welfare is a false one. The real question is, why some people have such low self-esteem, and choose such a strange and ineffectual way, to try to boost it?",31,7,10,1,13,22,15,7,0,15,0.03225806451612903,0.3225806451612903,0.45161290322580644,0.42857142857142855

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, if colleges paid athletes it would create a strange kind of market for it. It would be like a free market, but it would be a market for college athletes. Even more so, I agree colleges would try to out bid each other, and that would come at the cost of education. Instead of putting the money where it needs to go to fund education, pay teachers, maintain the campus, etc. The money would go to bidding for athlete skill.   

I think it would be a bad idea, because then more colleges would focus on remaining competitive and education would fall to the back burner so to speak. I also think it would be a bad idea because it would cause more problems than it would solve because not everyone wants to go to college for sports, and would be unfair to others who did not want to participate in playing any sport for the college. Meaning people who went for science, engineering, IT, etc would have to maintain normal jobs to help them with their expenses while athletes get a free ride.

I also think it would make colleges head hunt more for talented sports players than it would for people who could help advance science and math. So my stance is athletes should go to college for education, not because they can get paid.",18,9,6,0,3,4,3,1,2,1,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.5180412371134021

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to students. It's a basic medical need. For girls of a certain age, they may be at school when they get their first period. Pads or tampons would be needed to address the issue at that time. 
I think that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
. Those are not taboo products so a pad or tampon should not be either. It should be treated like when a child scrapes their elbow and needs help. They are given a bandage to cover their wound. 

This brings up one issue though. Having tampons and pads at school for an emergency is one thing. Should they provide them for students to bring home as well? Not every student can afford to purchase such products. I think that if a student is in need, they should be able to get them from the school. It's similar to students who get free breakfast. If someone qualifies for that program then they should be eligible for free pads and tampons. 

It's a basic right to have the products that you need for medical issues. These should be provided if your parents can not afford them. It's not a luxury item. It's a necessity. Students should have access to these products. Some parents may find it wrong for the school to offer them. That's their right but we should only care about the welfare of these students. 

If a school can provide toilet paper and bandages then it can provide tampons and pads. There shouldn't be any debate about it. We have to put the student's medical needs before any issues with topics that we may consider taboo. ",31,7,18,0,6,11,6,5,1,5,0.0,0.5806451612903226,0.1935483870967742,0.44352617079889806

In my opinion, we do not need to worry too much about screen time.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, it is important to do so. Animals are more vulnerable to suffering than humans. Humans have many people speaking for them, while animals do not.  If we do not speak for them, nobody will. 
I think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals because they are not as complex as humans.
 It is easier to relate to the suffering of animals. Humans are more complex and it is harder to relate to them. Human interactions have ambiguity. Is the striking in self-defense, spanking, liberation of a country's people or oil, retaliation for cheating? There's many more questions and contexts to human-on-human violence, than human-on-animal. 

There's a large body of social context to animal empathy.  Nearly every culture has been taught to fear ""outsiders"" or other countries. It is easier to fear a stranger than it is to empathize with them.  With animals, many societies view them as lesser beings, tools or objects that we own. It is easier to empathize with something that we own than it is to empathize with a stranger.  We can all feel the loss when something we own is damaged. 

The complexity of the humans is the key difference. Humans widely accept animals as food, or clothing. But any other useless or senseless violence is more easy to be seen as just that: unneeded abuse.  With humans, there's a cloud of uncertainty that lingers of many interpersonal actions, and this makes all the difference.

In my opinion, it's perfectly natural to want to save your pet over a foreign tourist. The study that was referenced fits in with what I believe to be true. If anything I'm surprised that only 40 percent of people feel this way. 
I think that the reason why people are more empathetic toward animals is because they can't speak for themselves.
 They can't say when they need help. They can't tell you that they are in pain. I believe we see them like children who are unable to tell us what is wrong. It makes us want to take care of them. We see them as innocent and pure. If we don't take care of them, who will?

I know people who are like me and mainly just donate to animal charities. That's perfectly okay to do and there's a reason behind it that fits in with the results of that study. People tend to give to charities that help hungry children or people half way across the world. Animals tend to be forgotten though in that regard. That's why many people like me give primarily to animal charities, because they need it the most. 

We need to focus on taking care of animals more. They aren't just our pets, they are living creatures. I feel that the study shows that 40% of people feel this way. That is encouraging to me. It makes me feel hopeful. 

So is it wrong to care about animals when humans are also suffering? No. We can care about all beings equally. Sometimes we just need to focus on the ones who are being overlooked though. If an animals is not getting noticed or helped as much as humans then it's our job to step up and put them first. It's no different than trying to help with equality between humans.

One day, as they walked along the forest path, they stumbled upon a giant abandoned castle. It appeared to be in pristine condition, but no one appeared to live in it anymore. The pig was excited, for they thought that treasure might be found within the castle walls. The drawbridge was raised up, and a moat surrounded the castle. The water was deep, and it was not known what lurked underneath the surface. The pig cautiously walked up to the drawbridge, and looked around for a way to lower it. Seeing that the chains had rusted over time, they threw several rocks at it, hoping it would break. fter several rocks, the chains finally broke, and the drawbridge fell into place.
 The pig was free to explore the castle, and what secrets it was hiding. The pig explored the massive castle, seeing most of it in disarming, and deterioration. The pig thought to himself that the previous occupants had escaped a unknown threat, while some had raised the drawbridge to keep the castle to themselves. They searched the castle far and wide and could not find any items of value. However, the pig was not one to give up easily, and continued their search for treasure.

He wondered if his ancestors were here, and what happened to them. Regardless, he was able to find what he had hoped to discover, a hidden room with piles of gold coins and other valuable items. The pig found themselves in a state of jubilation, and wondered how they were going to carry all this treasure back home. Stopping to think, they realized they were already at their new home, and decided to keep the castle as their own.

In my opinion,it should be provided especially when and if it happens as an accident in school and the girl does not know that it is coming as it brings less embarrassment and a lifelong fear. Girls that do not know what a period is at the beginning of their puberty years can make a big deal out of it and it can cause a scar in their lifetime if they start to bleed all of a sudden in school and do not have pads or tampon to help with the flow. At least the state should have some kind of emergency kit implemented in every school and that goes for middle school right thru high school . For boys these are not things to worry about but for a girl this can be a big thing when it comes to their puberty years. If the schools do not have budget for kit as standby , they should have an option where all the teachers come together and could buy such a kit and keep it on hand. These girls reputation are at hands if they start bleeding in class and it can have a lasting effect right thru middle school or high school and brings a sort of stigma. Parents should also be aware or be more involved in their teen girls life of when they are starting their period, that may also help with the girls carrying extra pads or tampons in their backpacks so they can have them at hand anytime they need. Other than parents and teachers not having emergency pads or tampons on hand it would be up to the student to take care of such things , so in that case there should be more education about this in class, like a special class for all freshman when they first enter high school to teach them the basics. Or there should be books or dvd's provided to help them deal with the situation. That will help them in private to deal with these things and it will also give them more confidence in confiding in parents or even teachers about what should be done about the topic.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, dating apps have revolutionized dating. In fact, I think they have had a very dramatic effect on social behavior, in general. People are constantly on their phones, messaging each other. That's not all dating apps at work, but dating behavior is a significant part of text messaging. Dating apps have brought a lot of people into the dating world, that otherwise wouldn't have found their way in. It's been great for everyone. Lonely people are stepping back out into the world, and people who have always been outgoing have found a new, better outlet. It's opened up a lot of possibilities.

I have used these apps myself, probably most of them. I've had some great dates and some not so great dates. Every one of them was a learning experience, in which I found something about myself that I hadn't previously been aware of. These experiences have given me more confidence in my ability to communicate with strangers, and they've also improved my ability to socialize on a personal level. I feel like I'm a better conversationalist, in general, as a result of my using dating apps to meet some new, random people.

The idea of meeting up with a stranger, about whom you know very little, can be daunting. However, if you can get over that initial hurdle, then I think you'll find yourself having some great conversations with people. Even situations where the dating doesn't work out can be socially fruitful. I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. 

Dating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others. This is something that not everyone knows how to do, but once it is learned, it leads to new social connections with people, which can lead to a happier life. I recommend that everyone who is looking to meet new people try a dating app, at least once.",34,9,18,0,7,9,7,2,1,6,0.0,0.5294117647058824,0.20588235294117646,0.47186932849364793

They would be allowed to set up a hive of their own, as long as they did not bother them. This agreement would protect both the bees and the allergic man and his family. The bees would have a home and the allergic man could continue on with his life without worrying about being stung. This was a fair agreement and had a winning situation for both sides.

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it if not better. I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. or example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out.
 I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery.

He had contacts in eastern Europe that would pay a lot of money for even a little bit of the stuff. He went home and called one of them and asked them how much they would give the wolf for some. The wolf's contact said ""I'll give you $100,000 for a pound of it."" The wolf liked the sound of that so he went back to see the little pig to see if they could make a deal. ""Hey, little pig, can you get any more of this depleted uranium stuff?"" he asked. ""Sure, I can get a lot more of it if you want it."" the little pig replied.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, citizens dont necessarily have a responsibility to keep up with the news on an in depth level. They do however hold responsibility to know generally what is going on around them. For example, if a citizen is unaware of COVID at this time then they are simply putting themselves and others into harms risk. To be ignorant to something like COVID at this time is simply inexcusable. When it comes to what is going on in Afganistan, it is acceptable to know really know if you dont feel you play a part in it. What is happening in Afganistan is not exactly directly affecting the lives of every single American, so it is acceptable to simply not have heard about it. Not only this, but sometimes people may even choose to avoid news stories simply for peace of mind. So much of the news is negative, and if you are always reading it, it is impossible not to have a negative outlook on what is going on around you. I personally feel that it would be much easier to digest more news if there was more positive news. A big reason why i dont stay up to date often times is because i am not trying to always see all the stories on people dying, crimes, etc. I would rather focus on the good things in life, and try to stay positive. This being said, of course it can help to know what is going on around you, i just think that there needs to be balance. The media can take that balance away sometimes simply because they put on the news what they know people will watch. 

Engaging with the news does not always directly do anything, however there are times when people do attempt to make a change. Whether it is through protesting or simply emailing local government, people without a doubt can play a role in getting change to occur. The actual act itself of digesting news does not really have any effect though. I think some people simply feel better knowing all they can know, since the unknown can be scarier than the actual truth at times. So it is really different for everyone what engaging with news can do for you. If you feel that gaining the perspective from reading the news is positive enough, than it is a good thing to read it. If you feel like all the info is bogging down your mind and taking away from your ability to be present, it may be a good idea to either balance it or forgo it altogether.",25,6,18,0,1,3,1,2,0,1,0.0,0.72,0.04,0.4503968253968254

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, the decision to listen to an audiobook rather than to read a printed book is a matter of personal preference.  There is not really an objective reason that the majority of the population should prefer one medium to the other.  It could come down to preference, or to convenience.
For me, I enjoy listening to audiobooks because it allows me to multitask while I plearn and absorb information.  For example, I can perform numerous small tasks around the house or yard that do not require my full attention, yet take up considerable amounts of time.  I can now use this time to learn new subjects or to absorb engaging fiction.  This gives me more opportunities to learn than I would have had if I had to sit down and read a book, without doing anything else.
I would think that you would learn just as much by listening to a book being read to you vs.
 reading the words off of a page, and it seems to work for me.  Other people might not find it so easy to retain information that they hear.  
WSoothis is one of the key strengths f Audiobooks?: the convenience factor.  There are other people who might find it difficult to actually read printed words.  Those who suffer from dyslexia, for example, are just as capable of learning as anyone else, but reading is physically difficult for them.  For these people, audiobooks would be a great improvement over printed words, even if they choose not to multitask.
I will however say that there are some subjects that I have had difficulty learning from an audiobook, including math and physics.
  Subjects such as these often require visual aids such as diagrams and printed equations, so they do not lend themselves to an audio format.  People who have trouble reading, however might use a hybrid approach, in which they listen to an audio version of the material, while holding the book in front of them.  This would allow them to pause and view diagrams, when necessary.

Obviously, books about art history and fashion would also suffer in an audio format, as photographs are a key part of the material.  

T summarize, I would encourage yanytreader o give audiobooks a try.
  They may find that it allows them to learn more than they ever thought possible.

However, I do not dispute the simple pleasure of sitting down and reading.  Personally, I like to read light fiction myself as a way to unwind and fall asleep at the end of a long day.  Listening to audio books does not provide me with the same level of relaxation, but again, this is a matter of personal preference.  

The simple fact is, that audiobooks are a great tool, that may be helpful to many people.

If you want to know more, there are apparently over 20,000 audio titles available, and one has to assume that the list is growing at a regular pace.  There are even books that are narrated by their own authors, or by celebrity actors.  

One book that was recently recommended to me is ow to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren
.  I might pass this recommendation along in either its printed or its audio format to anyone who is interested in reading or listening to more serious educational content in their lives.

As we have seen, absorbing more books may be a lot easier than you think, so what are you waiting for?

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""


You have no idea what JFK could mean by this, but you're intrigued.
 After all, hasn't JFK been dead for many years? Hesitantly, you call the number he's given in the letter and you speak to him. A man answers and you are surprised that the man's voice is the one of a healthy middle-aged adult. If JFK were alive, he'd be ancient by now and his voice would be gravelly and raspy. It would not be as vibrant as it is on the phone. 


Nonetheless, you speak to the man who claims to be JFK.
 This man tells you to meet him in Bermuda. JFK tells you that he's sending a plane for you. You are completely mystified and stupefied. You ask if Michelle can come along. ""No, it's just you."" You protest that you can go nowhere without Michelle, and that she will most certainly be suspicious that you are having an affair if you go off to Bermuda on a random whim without notifying her at all. ""I'm sorry Barack, but you have to do this alone,"" JFK says. ""You have no choice in the matter.""

That night, you go home to Michelle and tell her that you have received a strange letter asking that you travel out to Bermuda, and that you must fulfill the obligations under the letter alone. You make up some nonsense about a new job. Michelle can see right through your lies. She knows that you don't have a new job. After all, you are happily retired. Your life is so much more calm and less stressful now. Why would you throw all of that away just because of a job offer? Your career is done and you know it and she knows it. This is a lie.

Michelle starts to ask questions. You are evasive. After all, you barely have any details about this job yourself, so you certainly aren't in a position to share such details with her! You deflect questions about the job and try to change the subject. Eventually, Michelle gives up. She knows that you wouldn't be pressing to go to Bermuda alone if you didn't have a very good and very legitimate reason for doing so. So she leaves the issue and heads up to bed. 


The next morning, the mansion staff are gathered and ready to chauffeur you to the airport.
 Off you go to Bermuda! The lines at the airport are short and you are surprised to be on the plane in under an hour from the time you set foot in the airport. When you touch down in Bermuda, you are shocked to see JFK waiting for you. He's alive! JFK greets you warmly. He tells you that he needs your help to do something tremendously important, and that it's up to you to stop a major threat. You are very concerned and ask what the issue is. He says he is trying to negotiate a cross-border peace treaty with Bermuda and that he needs your help. You immediately jump in to offer your help. It's not everyday that JFK will ask you to help with diplomatic relations! With your help, JFK is able to successfully resolve the matter. Peace is restored again to both nations involved in the threat. You are very happy that you were able to assist in this mater but you are even happier to have met JFK. You let JFK know that you are available to help him any time he might need it. JFK thanks you heartily. He says that he might indeed have need for you again in the future. The two of you shake hands and end the meeting warmly. ",54,5,33,0,16,16,16,0,2,14,0.0,0.6111111111111112,0.2962962962962963,0.41522988505747127

One day, a mysterious girl named Himari appears in his monotonous life and offers him an opportunity to change. Watashi is intrigued by the offerings of Himari and he wants to learn more about how she can enhance his life and fulfill his desires. Watashi asks Himari how she can change his life. Himari tells Watashi that she has the power to give him anything he desires. Watashi is fascinated and wants to believe her but her is doubtful. Himari teases Watashi and tells him if he will believe her, she will give a demonstration of her magical powers. Watashi is curious and accepts Himari's offer and decides to believe in her.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, all that time spent in front of a computer or phone screen, even if it is understandable under the circumstances,  is not good for us. It is not good for our health, our relationships, or our ability to connect with the world around us. In terms of health, staring at a screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, headaches and neck pain. Though people might attempt 'online exercise programs', screen time in general leads to more sedentary behavior, and therefore to weight gain and obesity. It also creates trends in behavior that might carry on into the future, when the virus is no longer a concern, so these negative impacts on healthy behavior could be long-lasting.

When it comes to relationships, looking at other people via a screen is not the same as interacting with  them in person. Particularly when it comes to children, there is a lot of research showing that the more time they spend on screens, the less time they spend interacting with their parents and siblings. Certain social and behavioral cues can't be conveyed on a screen; the same is true of the non-verbal cues that are so important to communication. While the impact on adults might be relatively minor, all this screen time is causing a generation of children to miss out on the important developmental benefits of face-to-face interaction.

In terms of general connection with the world around us, screen time is causing us to miss out on real things, occurring in our neighborhoods and communities, and focus on arbitrary things, occurring only on the internet. or on the other side of the world. In this way, screen time is causing us to lose a proper sense of place and connection with the world around us, and by that, I mean the portions of the world that should be important and meaningful to us. Instead we're ending up with stronger connections to people we will never meet, places we will never visit, and things that don't really affect us.

The fact is, the dramatic increase in relying on computers and the internet to get by, was meant to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem. It was never meant to be a permanent solution to a long-term problem, and if we treat it that way, we may find that the problems it causes, are far worse than anything caused by a novel flu virus.",21,6,1,1,13,22,16,6,0,16,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.6666666666666666,0.493801652892562

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

In my opinion, being updated with news is part of being a responsible citizen. Being aware of what is happening is necessary for us to be able to navigate through our lives in an informed fashion and to be able to come up with effective decisions when it comes to our lives.
I think that all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world.
  Not keeping up with news would lead to poor decisions that can affect people around us negatively in that we might not be able to make the right decisions when it comes to our lives.

Engaging with current events will also give us the information we will need for most of the things we do. For example, we can track the traffic by monitoring the news; for people doing trading it is essential that they track current events specially on the trades they are planning to make for the day or the future. Also for people in the technology field, being aware of what is happening and being informed on the general state of the art would save them time in coming up with inventions that have already been solved.

hy do I think the way I do?
 That is because, I believe that being informed is the first step in making the right decisions, and that being informed would lead to a better future.  It would be appreciated in the long term, if we all keep up with the news. And maybe someday we will also be a part of the good things that we see in the news.

This, the other nations had complied with, but they had secretly built up their conventional forces to the point where they could defeat the United States in a non-nuclear war. Since the U.S. was gullible enough to fall for the ruse of isolation, they assumed that the U.S. had complied with the nuclear disarmament, and were shocked when they found out that the U.S. had not.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotype that makes me cringe in movies most often would be the popular people in high schools and middle schools. For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way.

 It wasn't all dads. And strangely enough, it seemed like it was mostly dads whose mugs had had high rankings before. But it was enough to make everyone very nervous. Which was the right reaction because soon other people starting disappearing as well - show producers, certain politicians, and company heads. And then the message came. 
""The world has been ranked.
 We saw your problems and tried to help you. We believed you wanted to improve. But you only became worse. So now we will fix your problems ourselves."" 

And they did. Thousands and thousands, millions even, of adults disappeared. And new parenting handbooks appeared in every household, along with a list of consequences if they were not adhered to. 

Eventually humans got used to being under the control of the aliens. Maybe it wasn't a perfect solution, but the world did seem like a calmer, quieter place. The mugs eventually returned. And from then on they all said #1 Dad. Or else.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think that we should focus on human welfare first because humans are more important than animals. I think that we should focus on animal welfare after we have taken care of humans. Animals need protection and caring from humans, so humans should have a good physical and mental status before they can take care of the animals. If humans are suffering, how can they focus on animal welfare? Humans are the leaders of the world, so they should be saved before anything else. Otherwise, this world will be lacking in strong and fit leaders. 

In addition, the loss of a human life triggers more emotional consequences than the loss of an animal. For example, if you lose your dog, you will be sad for a while, but if you lose your parents or siblings, you will be very sorrow for the rest of your life. The death of a human is more serious than that of animal. For example, the death of a great scientist will cause a huge loss to the society because of their outstanding contribution to the society. However, the death of a dog will not cause any loss to the society.

To sum up, I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. ",19,7,8,0,4,10,4,6,0,4,0.0,0.42105263157894735,0.21052631578947367,0.4494047619047619

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools should be required to provide pads and tampons to students who need them. As a menstruating human being, I've experienced a number of inconveniences related to my periods, and sometimes it is due to a lack of access to these products when I need them. As an adult, if I experience this inconvenience it's easy to take a break to go get more, but a student in school does not have this option. Sometimes students don't have extra money to pay for something like a pad or tampon if they are for sale. They should not be forced to experience the unnecessary stress caused by such a predicament when they are in school. When students don't have access to these items it can create a situation where they can't focus because have no protection from bleeding on themselves, or even worse they can actually have an accident which is not only unsanitary, it can result in them being humiliated by the experience. No young woman should have to go through that in a school when the school could prevent it by providing access to the products right there at the school. Pads and tampons, in my opinion are similar to first aid items because if one is needed, it is absolutely NEEDED NOW.  First aid items are provided to those who need them in schools so I believe that pads and tampons should be too. They are somehow different because they aren't used by both genders, but to deprive ONE gender of items they literally can't be in public with out would place an unfair burden on females. So in conclusion for all these reasons stated, I definitely believe schools should, without a doubt, be required to provide pads and tampons to the students who need them.",17,7,7,0,3,4,3,1,2,1,0.0,0.4117647058823529,0.17647058823529413,0.4945945945945946

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""
The wolf was like, ""dude, I'm not going to blow that house down.""
  The pig was puzzled.  Everyone in town knew that the wolf blew EVERYBODY'S house down whenever he had the chance.  Only the pigs rich to build brick houses were safe.  Pigs saved for years to finally have a wolf-safe house.

""I'm glad to hear that, but why, may I ask, are you leaving my house alone?"" 

""Because your house is made of depleted uranium."" 

""I know that, but why is that important?"" 

""Because it's radioactive.""

""Why does that matter?"" the pig asked.

The wolf explained that if he blew the house down, the radioactivity would spread and cause everyone to get sick.  The pig hadn't realized he'd built a dangerous house.  He thanked the wolf profusely and contacted the local government to have the house safely removed.  He couldn't afford a brick house, so he had to put up a straw one.  Before the wolf could come and blow it down, the pig paid him a visit with a bouquet of flowers.

""Man, you saved my life,"" he told the wolf, and invited him over to his house for dinner the next night.  The wolf was shocked.  None of the pigs had ever thanked him for anything or been nice to him.  He agreed and visited the pig's house the next night.  They had a nice dinner and over coffee and cake, they chatted about why the wolf blew down everyone's house.  The pig said that he'd been told that the wolf was a bad guy who blew down houses just to be mean.  

""Nah,"" the wolf said, ""I'm just bored and lonely.  It's tough being the only wolf in a pig town.""  

The pig realized that the wolf wasn't the only bad guy.  The town of pigs had made the wolf an outcast and weren't nice to him.  At the next town hall meeting, the pig brought this up.  He said he thought the wolf would stop blowing down houses if he were integrated into the community.  Pigs started to get to know the wolf and realized he wasn't a bad guy.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school, is a trade.  In my case, I learned all sorts of things in school, of varying degrees of importance and utility, but I'd define my education not by any of those, but by the most important thing I *should* have learned, but did not, and that was a particular set of skills, which I have since had to learn on my own, that would have made me a much more valuable and employable person.  I'd also have a much more comfortable lifestyle, and I think that's what school should aim to provide students.

Look at the situation. Students go to school for 16 years, and that's far more time than needed to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All those things are learned in the first few years of school, and after that, it's just a matter of learning more advanced versions of the same stuff. Then, after graduation, students are expected to work for a living, and they're expected to be able to do a job that requires a lot more than just reading, writing and arithmetic. So, they have to either go to college, where they hopefully learn a trade, or other means of securing decent employment, or they have to enter the workforce and learn it on their own.

So then, I ask, what was the point of those 16 years? Why did I have to spend all that time in school, when I could have dropped out much earlier in my life, and  learned a trade? What's the point of a school that, upon completion, requires yet more school? If the end result of all this is employment, and I think we have to acknowledge that it is, those 16 years were an almost complete waste of time. Is it really fair, or reasonable, to subject students to a decade and a half of compulsory education, when the end result is that they have to spend another decade and a half learning things that they should have learned in the first place? Is it fair for it to be done at the taxpayer's expense?

I say that it's not. Students are given over to the school for all that time by parents, and the school is supported in its endeavors by the taxpayer, with an expectation of producing useful results, as measured by employability. For all that time and money to be spent for nothing, isn't just an example of misplaced priorities in education.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should be both worried about excessive screen time, but also glad that the pandemic did not hit so early that we would be denied the chance to use our screens in this fashion.  
I am worried about screen time bin general, not just during the pandemic, ecause I believe that it is a major factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity and the rise in childhood diabetes.
  This is, of course, also a factor of portion sizes and the increasing amounts of sugar and fat that are included in convenience foods that are marketed toward children.  Given that most families have two working parents, and some of them have more than one job, we cannot pass judgment on families for this outcome.  They simply do not have the time to cook at home or to engage in vigorous exercise with their children.  If screens were not so enticing to children (perhaps, because we lived in an earlier time) or because parents were deliberately denying their children screen time, then it is possible that they would play outside more often.  This additional exercise would be good for their bodies and possibly their minds as well.  
I am also worried about screen time because of the potential for addiction.
  Video games and social media are almost tailor-made to feed out brain's desire for feedback and stimulation, and it can be hard to drag ourselves away from devices that give us what we want.  

Although these trends are worrying, we have to accept the world as it is, and there is little that we can do to change other people's behavior unless they themselves are willing to change.  This would require a mutual desire in both children and parents to limit their exposure to screens, and this perfect situation is rare.  

My broader point is that we should be worried about screen time, especially for children.  We should also be worried about the amount of time that we spend on our own screens, and we should try to limit our screen time as much as possible.  Social media and even video games can have the same effect on adult brains as they do on children.  Likewise, a sedentary lifestyle can be unhealthy for anyone, so we need to force ourselves to get up and move, preferably outside.  

When it comes to the pandemic, however, I think we have to accept that screens (while dangerous when over-used) are very helpful.  We need to be able to communicate with our families and friends, and we need to be able to access information about the virus.  Internet-connected devices may feed our addictions, but they also allow us to keep in touch with the people we care about.  If kids were playing outside with their friends, they might have spread the virus and caused much more loss of life than we have already seen.  And keeping kids indoors, in isolation, without any way to communicate would probably be worse for their long-term health than excessive socialization on the internet has been.  

And so, te bottom line is that we should be worried about screen time, but we should also be glad that the pandemic hit when it did.
  Screentime has been a crutch that has helped get us through a very difficult period in our lives and in our history.  However, whenever we are safely able to do so, we should try to return to a life in which interactions are sometimes made in person, and in which people interact in the real world.  It is healthier for us on so many levels to be active, social, and connected.  Once the acute risk of disease has passed, or has at least been controlled, we should try to get ourselves back out there.",30,6,19,0,5,6,5,1,4,1,0.0,0.6333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.4414668547249647

In my opinion, people can sometimes be more empathetic toward animals because they don't challenge us the way that other people do. A dog will never argue or disagree with you the way a human will do. Some people simply don't like being challenged or presented with any resistance because of weaknesses in their personality. When a person is disagreeable or otherwise hurts our ego, people sometimes see them as less than human. This happens with discrimination against groups.
In some ways, people see their pet dog as an extension of themselves. For this reason they are likely to care more for the dog than other people.

I believe most people would find this concept interesting and would want to know more about it. It would also be pretty cool to watch the main character of a movie reincarnate as you would essentially get to see all of their lives in one movie. 

Reincarnation overall is a very conceptual idea that has roots in ancient culture. I believe this movie would be a great way to get people thinking about the idea of reincarnation. Most ancient cultures had at least some beliefs that a person would come back after death. This movie would be a great way to show how the idea of reincarnation has impacted the culture in general. In a way, it would help people wrap their heads around the concept and possibly learn how it has been viewed throughout history. I think that this movie would be very popular and would be an interesting concept to watch. The movie could begin with a man waking up and throughout the movie, it shows flashbacks of the man's past transgressions and what led up to the reincarnation event. This would allow the viewer to become more invested in the man and develop an interest in what he did so wrong that caused a reincarnation event. 

In closing I do believe this is a fascinating idea for a movie and actually has some roots in our history overall. The movie could even go into how different cultures view reincarnation and show examples. This would be a great way to get people thinking about this fascinating topic.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---
 Stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that makes me cringe are ones that are basically offensive to a group of people in some way. Especially characters that demean or reduce racial groups to negative traits, or even traits that puts them on a pedestal. I think I especially cringe regarding many stereotypical characters that end up making fun of minorities, either based on race, gender, and sexuality. I think these characters effectively hurt others especially when they get compared to them by others, and in general I can emphasize with their struggles. In terms of whether I would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, the answer would be effectively yes. While I can understand that some depictions in past movies are based on the era and mindsets that were prevalent in said time period, I would rather not watch it based on how uncomfortable and negative I would feel from watching such offensive portrayal of people. In addition, I would say the same amount modern shows or content. I would rather stop watching a show or movie if I ended up feeling uncomfortable from watching it, more so if it stems from a stereotypical character. There is plenty of shows and movies I can watch that does not rely on stereotypes for its characters, and books I can read that do portray people in a negative manner. For the most part, authors, directors, and writers can make content for people that is respectful and depicts people in a realistic manner. That doesn't mean the content they write needs cannot delve into serious topics or touch on controversial issues, but at the same time it does mean they should use characters that are relatable and realistic to their audience. Although stereotypes persist in society and are perpetuated by many, they do not need to be shown in the media people consume in their daily lives. Stereotypes ought to be confronted by people in society and reduced until it no longer affects the people in negative manners, this includes the ones that many pieces of media and entertainment still unfortunately show.",16,4,10,0,2,8,2,6,0,2,0.0,0.625,0.125,0.4823232323232323

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the people who make me cringe on tv change over time. I can't stand watching Al Bundy, because some of the things that the character says are deeply offensive, and I can't laugh about that. That's a contrast to how I felt about the character in the early 1990's, when I was in my early 20's. I thought he was hilarious back then. I wasn't mean spirited, I just thought it was all a funny joke. As time went by, I learned that the joke was at the expense of real people. Instead of laughing, I began feeling uncomfortable and uncertain that I wanted to watch that program anymore.

I wonder sometimes if the things I'm laughing at today, that comedians say or do, will some day be as offensive to me as Al Bundy has become. What will be my tipping point for comedy? The shows were all taped, and they are identical to what I watched back then, when I watch them today. The only thing that has changed is me. I can't say that society has changed, because there isn't a lot of real evidence to suggest that it has. My tipping point seems to be related to my level of experience, to what I've learned about the world. As I learn more, some things that I once found funny no longer have a balance between funny and wrong, and they tip into offensive territory.
The example that comes to mind is ""cracking"" on someone's weight.
 I see people in movies, from time to time, making snide remarks or outright making jokes about another character's weight. When I was young, I thought that was pretty funny. Now I'm much older and I'm overweight myself. I've talked with many nice people who also struggled with a weight problem. When I see someone making light of that struggle with self image, I can't laugh at that anymore. I now see it as hurtful, and I really don't know how some people continue to laugh at that, because it no longer seems very funny. Yet, not that long ago, in my life, I was laughing too.

It's difficult to explain what makes me cringe in a fictional character. It's a combination of the portrayal and the circumstances. The portrayal of Al Bundy will never change, because the show ended a long time ago. The circumstances have changed because, with age and experience, I've learned to approach life with more empathy. I think that, in the end, cringeworthy material is a matter that is too personal to label.",30,4,21,0,5,8,5,3,0,5,0.0,0.7,0.16666666666666666,0.45081967213114754

This discovery is truly shocking to the president of the United States at the time. Her name is Soeurette Morley and she decides to go on a rampage to make up for the fact that the U.S. has now lagged behind other countries so much to the extent that the United States is now no longer a global superpower. 
The United States is now a third world country.
 Soeurette Morley has been elected president for life and has been ruling the country with an iron fist for the past 50 years. Soeurette is determined to show the other countries in the world who's boss, but this is difficult because the past 50 years have put the U.S. at an extreme disadvantage relative to the other countries that did not go into isolation. By going into isolation, the U.S. ended up cutting itself off of all trade opportunities. The economy tanked. Innovation ceased. There was really no more motivation to create anything or do anything in the U.S. since there was no point; goods, products and services could not just be shipped to consumers in other markets and thus supply and demand seemed to totally plummet in the United States. 
Soeurette Morley decides to take the U.S. back to the top by any means necessary.
 She decides to invade the other countries that did not go into isolation. She decides to do this because she feels that the U.S. has been wronged and that the U.S. is entitled to take what it needs to take in order to be a global superpower again. 
Soeurette Morley is a very strong and determined woman., but ultimately this is her downfall since she does not know when to stop. She ends up obliterating the other countries, one by one, until the point where there are no other countries left for the United States to collaborate with. And without any way of capitalizing on the borders that are now open, the fledgling economy of the United States is fated to suffer a bad outcome. 
The United States is now in a very bad position.
 The economy is in shambles. And it is all Soeurette Morley's fault. She is now hated by everyone in the United States. She is forced to go into hiding. She is forced to go into exile. And she is forced to live the rest of her life in shame. But once Soeurette Morley is gone, the people of the United States begin to rebuild themselves and their lives. Once Soeurette Morley is ousted from her position, the whole country cheers wildly. Everyone is looking forward to being able to live their normal lives again and they could not do that before when Soeurette Morley was in power. 
The United States is now a democracy again.
 It is a place where people are confident that they have beliefs that will be heard and a place where people know that they can be in a country that will not put the heavy restrictions on them that other countries will. In conclusion, Soeurette Morley's ambition was her downfall, but that downfall led the United States to rebuild itself, so every story has its silver lining.

Eventually, the alien resorts to extreme measures, and simply sucks Matt Damon up into his spaceship on a beam of light.  

Matt Damon is terrified and confused, but the alien quickly explains that he is merely a huge fan, and just wants an autograph.

Matt Damon, being a celebrity, quickly forgets all about the famine and the invaders, and ends up basking in the admiration of yet another adoring fan.  

In fact, Matt thinks, he could make a fortune if the studios recognize all of the revenue that his movies are earning outside of Earth, so he asks for a tour of the planet, where he can meet more fans.

The alien shows Matt Damon around, and a few of the locals are thrilled to see him, but most of them just ignore him.  It turns out, that Matt Damon only has a few fans outside of the solar system, and only one of them has even watched his movies.  

Matt is disappointed, but he at least figures that he could get inspiration for a new movie from what he sees, so he asks to go to the library to learn more about the invaders.
The alien takes Matt Damon to the library, and Matt Damon is shocked to see that the library is a tiny, one-room
 building with a single display screen in it.

On that screen, Matt instantly watches the entire history of this planet, and all of his questions are answered.  

He asks to return to Earth, and even invites the alien to stay with him in Los Angeles.

The alien, however, refuses.

Matt Damon speaks English and the alien obviously doesn't. Luckily, the aliens have a translation device that can translate any language into their own alien language. Damon explains to the alien that Jason Bourne isn't a real person. He is just an actor. The alien understands and makes Matt Damon a deal.

The alien explains that if Matt Damon can get him in his own Jason Bourne movie, he will return Damon to Earth. The alien wants to live as Jason Bourne and the only way that can be accomplished is if the alien takes over the role that Matt Damon has been playing. 

Matt tells the alien that he will see what he can do and makes a call to the director of the Bourne series. Damon explains that his life is on the line and he really needs a favor. The director says that he'll do anything for Matt and tells him they can do a remake of the original Bourne Identity starring the alien.

Matt explains the deal to the alien and the alien agrees. The alien is sent to Earth and funnily enough he has the entire script memorized. These are the only English words that he can say, even if he doesn't understand all of them. To the directors surprise, the alien is a natural when it comes to acting.

Matt Damon is returned to Earth and is reunited with his family. The movie is also a box office hit and makes millions of dollars. The alien really was a natural. 

The alien left to go back to his home planet but he left a gift behind as a way to apologize and also thank Matt Damon. Matt Damon goes into his backyard and he sees a giant tarp with a note on it.

The ""Dad"" mugs are replaced with ""Dad"" mugs that are actually the correct ranking of Dads.


It's quite a shock to dads around the world.  Some of them already knew they were terrible dads.  But most of them thought they were better than the ranking that they were assigned.  I was away at college when I heard about what happened.  I found myself in chemistry class with my professor sipping from a mug that said #1,795,434,438 Dad.  I could probably have guessed that, given how he treated his students.  I found myself wondering if he didn't know what the mug said, or if he just didn't care.  If that were my ranking, I'd toss that mug.  I certainly wouldn't feel any pride in that number.

All over campus I saw professors with mugs of varying numbers.  I think the best I saw was 82,347,338.  That was for my economics professor, who I liked okay.  I found myself thinking almost constantly about where my dad must be ranked.  I thought he was a good dad.  He'd always provided for the family.  He rarely missed a Little League game and he helped with homework.  The more I thought about it, the less I could find wrong with my dad.  Sure, he worked a little too much, but he was always present and attentive when he was with me.  He taught me to ride a bike.  He taught me to shave.  He was kind to my dates, even if I knew he really didn't care for them.  My home was always a refuge for my friends who liked my dad as much as I did.
I found myself thinking about how much I loved my dad.
  I wanted to know his ranking, it was starting to pop up in my head unexpectedly.  But I didn't want to ask him.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in case it was a low number.  I didn't want to make him feel bad.  So I decided to wait until the holidays when I went home.

The last day of school was finally here.  I loaded my car and drove three hours to my parent's home.  When I got there, I hugged my parents.  They were so glad to see me, and we spent the evening chatting and catching up.  I got up early the next morning before anyone else was up.  I was so curious, I started going through the cabinets looking for my dad's #1 Dad mug.  I know he had one; I had gotten it for him when I was 5 or 6.  But I couldn't find it anywhere.  I searched the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, and the basement.  I didn't realize that someone was in the room with me as I was searching through the hall closet.

""Son,"" I heard my mom say.  ""Can I help you find something?""

I turned around, looking guilty.  ""Umm, I was just looking for something,"" I said.

""You're looking for your dad's #1 Dad mug, aren't you?"" she asked?  ""There's been so much made of that.  I'm glad your father's got broken a couple of years ago.  Ridiculous.  Like anyone could rate dads!  Sure, you can categorize them, but put them in order?  There's definitely not one number one dad. All that matters is how YOU feel about your dad, not a number""
I was relieved.
 My mom put into words what I had been thinking. It didn't matter if my dad was ranked number 1 or number 50 or number 2, 987,334.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms.  think pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines in the bathrooms because it is a necessity. but not as much as a band aid so the school system should be compensated for providing them. It will also help girls to learn responsibility. It will be up to them to carry $5 at all times just in case they need to use the girls vending machines or to bring their own from home which is encouraged. I look at it this way, girls have survived periods for all of existence but a cut can get infected and kill a person so it is much more important that we provide them instead. We need to make sure that bandages and antibacterial cream is top priority, not pads and tampons. If a girl does have an emergency of sorts she can go to the clinic and they will provide her with gauze to use in the meantime. Gauze is much cheaper and just as effective. 
I also think we should take time educate the students on periods and how they work that way there is no issues if a girl has an accident. Everyone will understand and just get on with their school work. 
This is the kind of system I see being most effective.

---

The amount of cruelty in the world is staggering. Many millions of living things, human and animal, are made to suffer at the hands of others daily. It makes no sense to say that harm to animals is less important than harm to people, because there is no way to find a characteristic of people that makes them more important in a moral calculus than animals.

What morally-relevant characteristic do humans have that animals don't? Intelligence?  No, because some animals are smarter than some humans (e.g., a a chimp has more intelligence than a newborn baby). Self-awareness? Animals are self aware. Ability to know right from wrong? Many experiments show a moral sense in some animal species.

The list goes on. There is really no morally-relevant characteristic that decides what is more important: human or animal suffering.

That means all harm to all living things is morally relevant. And people should care about both. It's not that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. It's that there cannot to a moral defense of such a view that is neither circular nor specious. It must simply be a matter of personal preference -- and that is okay. Some will be more moved by animal suffering than human, and vice-versa.

400,b27f544a5f6e4989aa95af488cfeaadb.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme mountain climbing is a sport that is too dangerous for people to participate in. I recently heard about an extreme mountain climber who died of his injuries after successfully climbing Mt. Everest. He had an altitude sickness that rendered him disoriented and unconscious. And on top of that he was going blind from cerebral oedema, which resulted from a fall he had suffered shortly after his successful climb of Everest. It was quite a scary story to learn about. Upon reading that article, I really felt sympathetic for this man's family because I could only imagine the pain and suffering he must have been enduring as he was losing his sight and crumbling from altitude sickness. I looked up his wife's Instagram account after he passed and it was clear that the family was devastated at the loss. She was obviously coping very hard. One of the most gut-wrenching things that I read from her was that she couldn't bring herself to watch the video of her husband's last climb. She had posted a picture of the video with the caption, ""Never mind, I can't watch it. It's too painful."" And yet he had done this climb knowing very well that it was dangerous and he might not make it back alive. This made me feel angry because he was clearly putting his family through unnecessary torture, if it came to that. And he was perfectly willing to do so even though he had a wife and three children. When I saw that she had posted Instagram stories about taking her kids to his grave, I felt even more angry. Her three children were all too young to be left without a father. And now he's left her to deal with his death along with all the burdens of being a single mother. Quite frankly, his recklessness with his life and that of his family's is a form of selfishness.

So I don't think that society should condone that kind of recklessness. We all know how much Americans glorify sports. We hold most professional athletes with a high regard and most people would probably hate to see a certain sport banned. We love to cheer on our favorite players at the Olympics. We love to watch the big game on Sunday as some of the best players in the world show off their talent. Some of the most lucrative advertising deals in America involve professional athletic competitions. And we all know how much the youth in America love their baseball, football, hockey and similar sports. So it's safe to say that athletics are an important part of American culture and we love to cheer for people who take these sports to the extreme.

But really, we shouldn't let it get to that point. There is a difference between rooting for an athlete and rooting for an insane person who puts his life at risk for thrills. We as Americans need to decide where we draw the line between what we think is reckless and what we think is acceptable. Personally, I think that extreme mountain climbing is a sport that shouldn't be allowed due to the inherent danger. We shouldn't call it a sport because it's more like a death wish. If someone were going on a suicide mission, I wouldn't want to cheer him on, I'd want to put him out of his misery by getting him help and counseling. I feel the same way about extreme mountain climbing. We should not glorify people's desire to put their lives at such extreme risk. And for this reason, we should not call it an actual sport. 

If I were to draw a legal distinction between what I consider dangerous versus what is dangerous enough to constitute a ban on an activity, I would use examples from the United States Code. Specifically, I would use the precedent set by the Hicks Memo. The Hicks Memo set out criteria to identify inherently dangerous activities while still allowing the government agency to regulate while taking into account the countervailing policy interests. There aren't really many countervailing policy interests that implicate extreme mountain climbing, which means that the balance of factors would weigh heavily in favor of a ban.

I urge you to avoid making this activity into a sport because it is too dangerous to do on a regular basis. I'm just looking out for your welfare. I don't want you to end up like that extreme mountain climber who was left blind and died of cerebral oedema. It was a totally avoidable death and you don't need to take such a risk with your life if you know better.",49,5,9,1,34,40,39,1,0,39,0.02040816326530612,0.1836734693877551,0.7142857142857143,0.43443557582668185

The aliens let out a sigh and picked up the phone, dialing Matt Damon's agent. ""Yes, we received your last 5 messages. And the... 57 before that. Yes, we know we haven't signed the appearance contract. Yes, we know there is an extra fee for out od country work. Yes we received your rider requirements. Human, do you not know who we are? What we can do to you?""
Alien:, ""ight click me., you $(#*^&#*$&."" The commander hung up on Matt Damon's agent (again) and turned to the cursing crew man. ""They won't stop with the scam calls Sir! This one keep saying he was from Microsoft and they had reports we had viruses and...."" 
Commander, ""I don't care how many times a day they call us.
 Don't give in. We'll be out of range eventually."" But he was wrong. Every time they tried to run out of range, a new call would come in. Not just one call either. All communications terminal, lines, means of communication. The scam and spam calls were non-stop. And if there was a break and a real call got through...it was just 10x worse after. 

""How long do you think they can last like this?"" asked the commander. His chief scientist approached to give his report. Sir, it appears their is no life form in the galaxy stronger, more resilient, or more persistent than the 'scam caller'. I recommend we return the Matt Damon specimen immediately."" 

But the commander shook his head. ""My wife is going to be so pissed at me. Matt Damon is the one thing she asked for for her birthday. I promised her I would bring him home. I had heard about this scam call plague before we left and I was sure it would be taken care of by the time we got back.""

The scientist shock his head. ""Better to return him now rather than risk bringing this plague back to the homeworld."" 

The commander eventually agreed and they made the decision to turn back. The scam calls continued, and were a torment, but Matt Damon was quite delightful. The crew grew soft and coddled the earthling. They were all a little sad when they returned him to the planet. 
Off in the distance, Matt Damon's agent could be seen holding a large check, laughing hysterically.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, this could be considered selfish if a person has a family and children at home. Whenever a person engages in an extreme sport, they are taking the danger and the risks that go with it. It is possible that they could end up leaving their family behind if they are injured or worse on one of these daring adventures. Although most people train hard for these experiences, not every scenario can be accounted for so a person could be left unprepared for many types of events. It is very rare that these kinds of accidents happen, but they do happen. While it is sometimes worth the risk to be happy, too much risk can come back to cause severe harm. The consideration has to be, how much of the sport is ingrained into a person's happiness and if the person gives up the sport so that they can be sure to be there for their family, will the person become resentful and angry? It is the hard decision to make, but one that has to be made. Even though anything can happen at any time, there are activities that come with more risk than others. Extreme sports seem to be one of those. As much as a person does not want to admit this fact, their family might be the thing that makes sure they are always careful and never taking any unnecessary chances. There are times when a person can think of the thrill that is felt on a mountain top or the one that is felt while doing a certain sport and nothing can really replace that feeling. The trouble is that these sensations are so controlled by adrenaline and endorphins that it is only a fleeting feeling. The feeling of wanting the thrill and adrenaline rush will continue to increase over time. Eventually, the feelings of wanting that rush will outweigh the need for family and a feeling of being at home. As a person's desire to pursue this thrill increases, their need for family decreases. This type of situation needs to be anticipated prior to any lifetime commitments and conclusions and agreements need to be made. A person might not even have to make that decision but it would be good for them to know what might happen if their focus does change. This is a reminder for people to always have time for the family and not to focus all of their time on work or hobbies which eventually become so important.",23,5,6,0,12,13,12,1,1,11,0.0,0.2608695652173913,0.5217391304347826,0.46060606060606063

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, it is hard to argue that current screen time usage is not a bad thing.  In my day to day life I see that people are more and more disengaged from the world around them.   They are more and more isolated, and they are less and less able to connect with others.  I see this in nearly every part of my life,   from the people I work with, to the people I meet in my travels, to the people I know in my personal life.  At school students are more interested in their phones than their classes and have to keep checking for updates.  At work people are more interested in their phones than their coworkers, a group at a lunch table will only be studying their phones, and not talking to each other.  At home my family will separate from each other and each go to their own room to watch TV or play games.  During sports games I see participants getting anxious that they have not looked at their phone for a number of minutes, and they will sneak away to check to see if they have missed anything.  The pandemic has made this worse, as many of us have been forced to use screens for nearly every part of our lives.  This has just accelerated a trend toward screens, and it seems like we've nearly reached the end point where people are completely disengaged from the world around them.  To me there is real hard, as people become dehumanized and empathize with others less and less as they become more and more isolated.

---

In my opinion, I dont necessarily find it to be selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. I think everyone who participates in a sport like that has their reasons why they do so. People who like these sort of extreme sports often have a need for that sort of adrenaline that they get when they participate in the sport. If they were not to be able to use the sport to get their adrenaline, i am sure they would just find another place to do it. Often times there are not many normal life events or activities that can fulfill this same purpose, and this is why people turn to these sports for that gap. While it can of course be very risky to do these types of activities, it is that person's choice at the end of the day. People are going to have the freedom to make their own choices regardless, and unless the mountain itself is closed down for climbing, i would assume people would engage in the activity. I think this can also give people a lot of fullfillment through the sport, and this in turn makes them a better person. People need a little risk in their lives sometimes to feel alive. If they have to climb a mountain to get their kick, or ride on a bike or skateboard really fast, why not let them do it? I am just not a big proponent on restricting anyones choice in this way, as long as they are not forcing other people to do the same activity or putting anyone into danger. Something like climbing, is an individual activity. If that person was to make the choice to go and do it, why not let them try? After all, they are trying to get some kind of fulfillment from doing this as opposed to doing other crazy stuff, and that seems like a positive thing. In a way it is sort of like a coping mechanism. I am the same way to be honest. I played football all my life through college and when i stopped i realized how i had a gap in my life. I realized that i needed some sort of sport or something to keep my mind up, so i wouldnt feel like i was living some sort of monotonous life. Many times people who do sports like these have that sort of brain that needs this adrenaline rush. I got into boxing after college because i needed it. I needed something that challenged me both mentally and physically each and every day. It made me feel like i was growing, and made me feel like i was progressing as becoming a better person in life. That is how these activities make us feel, and i dont think it is selfish whatsoever to take part in them. Now, depending on your skill level i would try to be smart about the challenge you take on. If you have never climbed a mountain before, and you want to try mount everest on a whim, and you have a family of eight back at home, and your a single parent. Well yea, this is probably selfish.  So every situation is different. If you are climbing for a positive reason than there is no issue with it at all. In the sense of putting climbing ahead of your family, this is selfish because you are putting your own interests at the top of the ladder. You know you need to support your family, and if you go who is going to. This is just not a realistic or smart risk.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, providing free pads and tampons should be as normal as providing toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other essentials in schools. Students should not be put at a disadvantage in school because of their home life, whether socio-economic, cultural or just how prepared parents send their kids to school.   Providing pads and tampons to students ultimately helps to give everyone an even playing field at school.  School can be hard enough for students, especially the older ones, and removing this, potential, problem that could lead to embarrassment and stigma will only improve the learning experience.  The price of doing this would be minimal, and the potential benefits greatly out weigh that costs.  To me, there is little, if any,  downside to this debate, some might argue that it is the responsibility of the parents to provide these resources, but this ignores that fact of the situation, that many girls go to school unprepared.   It is a well documented fact that many homes are unable to provide these and other necessities for students, and it should be the job of the school to do so.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks! All in all, there are far more advantages than disadvantages to audiobooks over traditional books and that is why I prefer them.",21,7,10,0,4,7,4,3,1,3,0.0,0.47619047619047616,0.19047619047619047,0.4818181818181818

In my opinion, there are few things more lazy than listening to an audiobook instead of reading a physical book. To me, this is equivalent of watching the movie instead of reading the book. Consider: you don't even have to know how to read to listen to an audio book! We are becoming a nation of idiots, and the increasing popularity of audiobooks is one more proof of that phenomenon. 

I want to people to be as smart as they can be, so here is my plea to audiobook listeners: STOP IT! Have you forgotten how to read? Have you ever even learned how to read? And if so, have you forgotten the joys of reading? It is absolutely, completely, utterly unacceptable behavior on the part of any grown person to abandon reading for an audiobook. It says volumes about the listener's laziness and cultural illiteracy.
TMost people read nothing longer than a Facebook post. Their written vocabulary is paltry, and they generally don't understand the nuances or complexities of the language. The land beyond 280 characters is terra incognita. Their thoughts are mostly superficial. Their verbal expressions are on a par with the grunts of snuffling swine. They are barely human, and if a billion of them were to die of COVID tomorrow, the world of literature would be unaffected.
Okay so I'm exaggerating a little.
 But people who prefer audiobooks to reading a physical book epitomize everything that's wrong with our society. Passively consuming information makes all information seem equal. Reading has been dumbed down to the simple act of listening, while the physical book has been superseded by the screen of a smart phone. 

Ignorance is on the rise. Just look who was president from 2017 until 2021: someone who had never read a single book in their life. Is it any wonder that he lived in a world of narcissistic fantasy?

In my opinion, when gay men are portrayed as one dimensional, feminine types it's unnerving. I'm a gay person and I like to watch a lot of TV and Movies and media content.  Many gay characters are well done and interesting, but there are some, particularly in old shows from the 1970s and before when treatment of gay persons, even the mention of them, makes them seem like pariahs. Like they don't matter or worse like they are simply bad or villains because of their sexual identity.

I find, when people are snickering about how ""gay"" someone seems or how they are ""queer"" or ""Nancies""... it's offensive. There are many classic TV and Movie portrayals where this is seen. One older Movie I recently watched, which was, during it's time, considered popular was the Movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges. Allusions to one or more characters portraying or ""making the move"" on another character were seen derisively, and as a horror. I find this demeaning and troubling. When watching shows like this I DO cringe. I realize it's from a time gone by, and things have changed, but they haven't changed THAT much.


I've seen other older shows or movies where this sort of thing was present and it troubled me, but the show or movie was well done
 otherwise. When this happens I REALLY cringe. It elevates how important the medium is or show and that allows for the negation of a whole class of people. I see this sort of treatment all the time in real life today, which makes watching something like this all the more irritating and cringe worthy. There are times I will switch something like this off. Opting for another show, or nothing instead. It makes me feel less than, and I worry that even reshowing something like this will make young people watching it think it's ok to do that in real life. That's not ok. I want to scream, but who do I scream to? Does anyone care any more?

I DO like that many gay writers and directors, such as Ryan Murphy, give strong and varied gay roles to actors, and portray interesting story lines that include all types of people. Focusing in on what different people do, in different situations instead of pigeonholing everyone. This is what I want to see. I opt for these stronger choices, things that make me feel like I matter. I want to live in today, making gay people normal, allowing for a space for everyone, and for everyone to feel safe.

In my opinion, there is one stereotype I see often in movies and television shows that bugs me and that is the dumb blonde female character. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a movie or show where a female character is blonde and is portrayed as being dumb.

 There is always something that comes off as sexist about that character too. She's typically attractive and wearing suggestive clothing.

It's as though the writers of these shows and movies think that women are stupid and that they need to be portrayed as such. If not, then they just think that others will find it funny. Either way I don't understand and I don't relate. And it is demeaning to portray women in this way.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, one decides where the line may be drawn based off of their own personality and thoughts. I can't tell you what is too extreme or too dangerous when it comes to sports and vice versa. 

I am afraid of getting hurt and therefore don't really put myself in situations for that to happen. You won't catch me going extreme mountain climbing, snowboarding, skiing or anything like that. 

I am a boots on the ground person. I'm not a risk taker and think that people who are adrenaline junkies and seek risks are nuts. But I'm not going to tell them that they can't jump out of a plane and they can't ski down an extremely steep mountain/slope. At the end of the day, we all make choices and decisions in our life and we have the freedom to live the way that we want to. I don't have the right to define what danger is for other people.

I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. Boxing and MMA are two of the most popular sports in the world and they feature blood and knockouts all the time. Those fighters know what they are signing up for and most of them love the competition. 

Extreme is a word that doesn't have a concrete definition. What's extreme for a certain portion of people is normal for others. Hence why there is no line that needs to be drawn.

The only time I think a line should be drawn is as a parent. If you as a parent don't feel comfortable with your child playing football for example due to fears of concussions and broken bones, that is entirely your right. Your priority as a parent is to keep your child safe. You get to draw that line.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters have no place in any story. They betray a deadening lack of imagination and creativity on the part of their creators. A stereotyped character is a kind of lazy short-cut, used by a writer who has no real faith in their own work. I don't like those types of creators, so I typically avoid their work, whether it is in books, games, movies, or television. So, my experience with these kinds of characters is limited.

However, some of the characters I've encountered that made me cringe that readily spring to mind include Harry Potter, Rey from the recent Star Wars films, and Abby from The Last of Us 2. Harry Potter 's portrayal as a wide-eyed twit who has to be saved by everyone else, succeeds without without any particular effort on his part but instead through his status as a 'chosen one'  was particularly eye-roll inducing; I always rooted against him, and I've avoided every Harry Potter movie since the first. Star Wars: The Force Awakens ' Rey is a straight up Mary Sue, with no particular flaws or accomplishments. She proceeds through the stories in a similar way to Harry Potter, and these are basically male and female versions of the exact same type of stereotypical 'chosen one' character. As a result of Rey, I gave up on the new Star Wars movies entirely.

Abby from The Last of Us was an unmitigated stereotype of an ugly, muscle-bound, violent, 'trans' or lesbian character that was included specifically to appeal to some potentially less-savory segments of the gaming audience, and I found her unbelievably offensive, and stopped playing the game within 15 minutes of having to endure her.

There are many older stereotypes in all media, of course. But I guess the point I'm trying to make, is that there isn't any special quality about stereotypes, they're just examples of poor writing, laziness and creative bankruptcy, and the stories that feature them are bad, and not worth watching. The burden is on the consumer, to avoid bad work, and support good work, and that includes work featuring offensive stereotypes, as well as any other kind of objectionable features.",17,4,3,0,10,17,13,4,0,13,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.5882352941176471,0.582716049382716

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

JFK has always been a bit of a prankster with you, so you're not sure if this is a joke or not. You decide to text JFK to make sure he's not just pulling your leg. 
JFK doesn't respond. to your text, which is unusual because he's always been a quick texter. In fact, you've never known him to not respond to a text. You decide to call him instead. 
JFK picks up on the first ring.
 ""Hey Barack, what's up?"" he asks. 
""I got this letter from you and I was just calling to make sure it wasn't a joke.""


JFK has no idea what you're talking about, and he's a little offended that you'd think he'd pull a prank like that. ""I didn't send you a letter, Barack."" 
""Well, I have it right here on my bedside table.""
 JFK asks you to read it aloud to him. 
""Well, it says 'I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.
"" 

JFK is a little creeped out that someone would be impersonating him. ""Well, why don't you call the number and see what happens?""

You decide to do a three-way call so that JFK can hear the conversation. 
The phone rings once, twice, three times...and then a voice answers.
 As it turns out, the voice belongs to none other than John F. Kennedy. You're confused, because JFK just told you that he had no idea who sent you that letter and swore to you that it wasn't him. You ask JFK what's going on, since he is also on the line as a looped-in call participant. 
JFK is just as confused as you are.
 But make no mistake, this is definitely JFK on the other end of the line -- in fact, it is definitely JFK on both ends of the line for the three-way call.

You have no idea what to think of the situation. You ask JFK to explain the contents of the letter and the man who answered your call responds, ""It's a job offer to come be my personal chef."" 
""But I'm retired,"" you say.
 ""Plus, I don't know how to cook. You know that, ever since I tried hosting that dinner party the one time and everyone got food poisoning.""

The man who answered your call has no idea what you're talking about, even though JFK was certainly a guest at the dinner party you are referencing and most certainly must remember the horrible food poisoning he got from eating your attempt at roasted chicken with a side of mashed potatoes.

Suddenly, you realize what must be going on. You must be living in parallel time zones or parallel worlds, because JFK is in one world and the man who answered your call is in another, even though both of these men are JFK. The theory is a little wonky but quite frankly, you're not sure what else to think. There is no other good explanation for these circumstances. The man who answered your call must have offered you the job as a chef because he doesn't realize, as the real JFK should realize, how bad your cooking skills are. 

You feel a little weird that you must have your feet straddling two different time periods, but you decide to go with it. I mean, you've seen weirder things while living in the White House.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology helps you initially find a relationship but then it can sabotage it after.  think it's great to use technology to find a relationship.
 I personally found my partner that way so I know it works. But once you're in a relationship, I think it's important to put the phone down and focus on your partner. That's a problem that many relationships face. People use technology to find their love but then they can't put their phone down to basically nurture the very thing they were wanting. I feel that technology can be addictive so people don't feel satisfied even upon finding love which may have been their ultimate goal in the first place. 

Our reliance in technology isn't going anywhere. We may as well embrace it to help us find love, especially right now during these difficult times. I think it's a great way to meet someone and it can be a great way to keep in touch with your partner. If you happen to both be busy or be in a long term relationship then technology is crucial to keep it going. I think it's important to have a balance though. Know when to put the phone down and know when to disconnect and focus on your partner. 

Other technology can bring us closer together such as streaming apps like Netflix. It's a great way to spend time together and it's a great way to bond. You can just sit there and binge watch a show together when you're both too tired to do anything else. I think in the past year that people have realized that more than ever. 

So with technology I'd say it's great to use a dating app to find love. But once you do maybe put your phone down more and just get on the couch and binge watch a show together. Something as simple as that is all that is needed to nurture that love you were seeking in the first place. ",28,9,14,0,5,10,5,5,1,4,0.0,0.5,0.17857142857142858,0.44525547445255476

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there is a real risk. Just because society has shifted its focus to a more pressing issue, doesn't mean that we don't still have a screen time problem. 
The real problem isn't the time that kids spend on their smart phones, tablets or computer screens.
 The problem is what they do with that time. We've watched them, through the pandemic, learn from virtual classrooms. This is an example of good screen time. We have also seen many children submerge into online gaming to an unhealthy level, as well as some other social networking applications that have created a diversion that leads to an unhealthy amount of time on a screen. 
We saw with this pandemic and the way society responded that most parents did not have a sufficient amount of control over how their children could use
 their devices. It is common today for kids to have access to their own screen, and many of them have built a simulated life on the networks. These networks have digital stores, simulated cities that are part of multiplayer games, and have access to an online news station that keeps kids up with current events. There is a lot of good there but, as with anything else, there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing. 
It's time to begin talking about the opposite of screen time, which is life time.
 Too many kids have been living through the pandemic in isolation. They haven't had the opportunity to go out and build new, real world, relationships. That has led to a lot more screen time than ever before. The more that kids use their screen devices, the less time they have for human contact and interaction in the real world. Since many of them have been stuck at home, if they don't get that interaction from immediate family they find that they can get it online. 

Unfortunately, the need for physical interaction pressures anyone that doesn't have a lot of friends to begin craving more and more screen time. It's an addiction, and it should be treated as such. We don't encourage addicts to continue to use. We shouldn't encourage kids using their devices for 18 hours of a 24 hour day to continue staring at the screen. Humans have a natural need for human contact and all of us, kids and adults, need the real world interaction even-more during stressful times like this

I believe that the best thing we can do for our kids is to give them the interaction that they crave. It can be difficult to find the energy to do that, after working all day, but it's more than worth the effort. 
The real world is where life occurs.
 We need to get our kids back into the real world. The screen world can be a really fun place, and there's a lot to learn, but it's not so very different than any other addiction. We need to offer an alternative and the best way to do that is to interact with them ourselves. I encourage everyone who reads this article to spend some time with their kids today.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports, and cross the line. 

 believe that the line between what is reasonable and what is not should be drawn at the point where the risk of death or serious injury becomes
 too great. With mountain climbing, an estimated 7000 people die every year, and many more are seriously injured.  Compare this with Football,  where less than 30 on average die each year. .  With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies. 
The reason that I believe that extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports is because they are not safe. for even trained athletes.  xtreme sports are nofteo nt regulated., and encourage too high of a risk. 

Extreme sports affect future generations. Our children see extreme sports, and think this behavior is fine. They see the glory and fame that extreme sports bring, and think that this risky behavior is what they should be doing. 
Extreme sports affect the economy.
 Extreme sports are the cause of many expensive injuries. People place an unneeded burden on the healthcare system, for their own selfish reasons.  How many people have been delayed needed surgeries because the latest daredevil was jumping over 30 motorcycles, or broke a rib trying the newest stunt? 

Extreme sports also affect the environment. They bring people to pristine areas, lugging heavy plastic waste that is often discarded.  The trash pile on Mount Everest is a good example of this.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes aren't needed to be paid for their time during tournaments they participate in. But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into. 

Hear me out: these college athletes already get a scholarship to play for their college, which is a lot of money. The average yearly expense of a student in an Ivy league school is costing thousands and thousands of dollars, which these athletes are getting for free. Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary.

However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from.

The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need.

So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need. That way, the NCAA will be entertaining, but at the same time, it will be helping those who are in need.",25,9,3,1,12,18,15,3,0,15,0.04,0.12,0.52,0.4469565217391304

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the Japanese-American internment during WWII is one of the most misused, under-utilized stories for media characters. If you look at the list of films that contain a Japanese American man or women, the prejudice is screaming at you. These films have instilled a lot of fear in the public , especially toward Japanese people. 
The fact is, without knowing how and why it happened, many people began to despise any Japanese person or culture.
 There became an associate of Japanese culture with violence and hatred. The reason for this misunderstanding is that cultures are often viewed as bad. People use the Japanese culture in a bad light to make it seem as though they are being “bad people.” Racism towards Japanese-Americans brought fear, this then affected many other cultures. 
Stereotypical characters are used to promote racism even in today’s society.
 Hopefully there will one day be an end to this. If we foster a positive discussion about the issue then we can understand history, and learn how to not repeat these events. Maybe there will be a shift in the way different cultures are portrayed in films.   It should not be a one-sided story, there should be multiple perspectives of characters of every race and culture. This is a truth that most people do not know, and will hopefully learn about. These stories can change history, instead of repeating the past.

Side effects include paranoia, schizophrenia, and a complete inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality. Hearing voices and seeing things that are not there is only one of the serious side effects also though. The more serious side effect is that, for some strange reason, you start to age backwards while remaining paranoid, and schizophrenic. 

This is a huge problem because as you age backwards, your mental state will also age backwards. Meaning you start to become more and more immature, until you become an infant and eventually turn back into a fetus and die because you body can't support itself anymore.

The cure is a drink that must be taken at exactly midnight of the person's birthday.
 Which isn't the issue, the issue is that people need to stop taking the pill. The pill had an additive quality to it. So doctors, the army, and police rounded up all the people taking it and dropped them onto an island by themselves with tons of food and water and doctors administering the cure.

---

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen use. The key word there is excessive. There is nothing wrong with using a laptop or a cell phone. The issue becomes when we rely too heavily on those devices. When instead of socializing with others and spending time with humans, we'd rather stay on our phone or laptop.

We had to rely on our screens during the pandemic. I think a lot of us would have went crazy without that because we couldn't really socialize with others. We couldn't go out. We had to stay inside and be as safe as possible. That means that our only way of entertainment was to watch television, use the internet, play video games, etc.

There is obvious value in screen time. We can get so much information from the internet nearly instantly. Screens can help us get from point A to point B via GPS.

The key to screen time just like everything else in life is balance. If we are using our screens too much it can have a negative effect on our social life as well as our physical health. Too much screen time can hurt our eyes.

I don't think this is an all or nothing topic. We can use our screens and embrace technology while not relying on them 24 hours a day. There are already trackers on our phone that show us how often we use our phone. How often we pick the phone up. Our average screen time each week.

We can use those statistics to see if we're using our phones too much. If we are, it's pretty simple...have some willpower and cut down on screen time. After all, social relationships will always be more valuable than anything you can find on the internet. Use your screens and enjoy your life.

In my opinion, the most important thing that student should learn in school have nothing to do with the subjects that teachers teach you. Just from my perspective, i think what you learn about yourself far exceeds anything you can learn in a class. I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. 

These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you learn about yourself. So in conclusion, the most important things that students should learn in school is about themselves. They should learn who they are as a person.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks have two major advantages–they allow you to multitask and/or get through a lot more books in a shorter amount of time. I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste. 
Further, listening to audiobooks can help improve your memory.
 Some people learn better through auditory means, and by listening to a book, they may be able to hear information more clearly. They may be able to remember things they may have otherwise forgotten. It can be very relaxing to listen to audiobooks, and can be used as a stress reliever. By combining audiobooks with noise-cancelling headphones, you can enjoy listening to a story without any outside distractions. It is like being transported to another world. Either way, audiobooks are gaining popularity and can be a great way to read more.",22,7,7,1,7,14,10,4,0,10,0.045454545454545456,0.3181818181818182,0.36363636363636365,0.5797665369649806

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually even lost a grip on reality!

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID.

In a school setting, students should not be preoccupied with learning information such as dates, stats, or other informative content that is more situational and not practical in many contexts, but rather life skills and experience.  he most important thing students should learn in school is how to think critically and screatively, while also learning how to apply themselves in different scenarios and situations. In addition, I believe school is a good place for students to learn how to cooperate with one another, and to learn how to work with others as a team towards a collective goal. 

All considered, I think the most important thing that I learned in school would be how to understand my limits and weaknesses, and pace myself in moving towards the goals I hold and wish to accomplish. This has helped me in various aspects of my life. By being aware of my strengths and weaknesses, I can better understand how I can best achieve a goal. For example, if I am working on a project with a group of people, I can better understand how to work with the strengths of others in order to work on the project, especially the strengths that I lack. I can also better understand how to pace myself in order to gain skills and knowledge, and not overextend myself which could lead to negative consequences. This includes in determining the optimal way for me to study for exams, as I am aware of how I best study, and that I know that spreading my study sessions is optimal for me to retain knowledge. 
I think that this knowledge will help me in the future, especially in my career. as it will guide my actions, and will allow me to apply myself in the workplace. It will help me identify opportunities that I can pursue, and I can remove any sense of hesitance by knowing that I am capable of pursuing the opportunity if I put my full effort towards it, and also work on it by utilizing my skills and strengths to the fullest. In other cases, the knowledge I learned from school will help me coordinate and work with colleagues, in maintaining a steady communication between one another, and allocating resources and work load to optimally achieve a deadline. The knowledge I gain from school has helped me trust in my abilities and allowed me to hold a stable sense of self-esteem, alongside with the ability to trust in others that I closely work with. n conclusion, I think that tis why knowing ones strengths and weaknesses and learning how to apply oneself is the ost important thing students should learn in school , given how universal such knowledge can be applied to the lives of students, both in their career and also in their personal interests.",20,6,7,0,7,9,7,2,4,3,0.0,0.35,0.35,0.4049429657794677

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the drastic increase of screen time ushered in by the pandemic, is a good thing. Society was headed in this direction anyway, and the pandemic only helped speed up the pace of society's inevitable digital transformation. So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits.

For example, as an information worker, I can now ""go into"" work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office. So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Increased screen time related to entertainment will always be a hotly debated topic, but I also see that as inevitable - it was already happening. Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

To reiterate, none of this is a surprise: I see the pandemic as just another, albeit excruciating way of speeding up society's inevitable digital transformation. So I say, we accept that, and along with all the terrible hardships brought about by the pandemic, acknowledge the fact that it's brought us this single, small blessing.",18,6,0,0,12,15,15,0,0,15,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.5253549695740365

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

If you have a 19 year old who is smart, athletically talented, with an average family and income and attending university on a sports scholarship what happens when they flunk out towards the end of their sophomore year because they were so exhausted from their team practice, drills, watching tape, fundraisers and other athletic activities on top of their 20 hour a week job needed to pay for gas and transport, that they fell behind in a class or 2. Don't they deserve a little extra help?

In my opinion, there are three things a student should learn in school that are most important. The first is how to communicate effectively. This is mostly learned through different exercises in reading and writing. In school  reading helps students learn to interact verbally with others. In fully learning language and how to say things correctly by practicing this, kids learn how to communicate with others in a way that is understood and helps them get around in the world. 
The second most important thing students learn in school is math. There are many different areas of math from counting to negotiating, that are so basic and are used by people every day. I know for me personally, I had one math teacher in 6th grade that really drove home how to use fractions and percentages in an everyday to make quick calculations. It was one of the most important things I learned because to this day I still use his methods to do everything from determine the price of groceries plus tax in my head, to leaving a proper tip at a restaurant. These skills honestly help a person be more competent making decisions in the real world. 
And the third and final most important thing that students learn in school is science. Leaning about everything from the biology of our own bodies and how living things evolve, to how plants reproduce and even how our ecosystem functions are vital to understanding the world around us. The more education one has in science, the more one can advance their understanding of the universe. It is also important to have a good base of scientific knowledge because our earth's climate is going through drastic changes and competency in this matter will be more and more important as time goes on. 
There are many things a student should learn that will help them but for many reasons I conclude that communication, math, and science will help a person most in life.",21,6,8,1,6,9,7,2,1,6,0.047619047619047616,0.38095238095238093,0.3333333333333333,0.4909560723514212

Men everywhere start to internally freak out.
 The entire social order has been challenged. No longer can anyone take credit where credit is not necessarily due. The fathers of the world are actually going to have to start putting some effort into it, if they want to maintain a decent ranking. The funny thing is, that nobody realized how important it is to do a good job as a father, to their central role as a human being, until they saw a ranking of themselves. Now it was serious, a challenge, a competition. The days of coasting on the ""fatherhood credit"" are over.

Fathers everywhere start looking for new, creative ways to express love and caring. No more hammering a winning attitude and hoping for a sports star attitude. If your kid hates you, your ranking will reflect that. You must get creative. Some fathers find that asking their children what they would actually like to spend time doing is the best approach. Some fathers find that they don't need to ask, but if they just listen they will find the answer. The result of the new system of fathers day gift rankings results in a much more open minded, sophisticated approach to fatherhood.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the basics. Those will get you through life if you go to college or not. Once you have learned those then you can focus on figuring out who you are. Finding yourself is really the most important part of school. You learn who you are and what you like in yourself and in others. It's a social learning experience just as much as it is about actual learning. 

People will take different things away from the experience. Some will learn how to work with others and how to be a team player. Others will learn that they prefer to keep to themselves in life. Some will learn how to be a leader and others will learn how to follow. These things will help to guide you in life. You'll figure out the type of job that may work for you. You'll also figure out who you want to associate with. 
I have learned a lot in school.
 For me it was just learning about myself primarily, but that was important. I learned that I like to take a different path than most. I like to do things my own way. That's what makes me happy. I'm not someone who wants to be defined by a specific title or job. People can't always understand that, but I'm okay with that.

So I think the most important thing to learn in school overall is about who you are. It's about learning how to be yourself and not worry about what others think. It helps to shape you into becoming your own unique person. School is important but not for the reason many people may think. It goes beyond just the books.",30,6,17,0,7,13,7,6,0,7,0.0,0.5666666666666667,0.23333333333333334,0.4353932584269663

For example, you do not become any more wise, you do not learn from your mistakes, and you are not able to become a better person.

You were convinced that your new life was following the path of your old one. That idea worried you, as you wondered if your new life would end up in the same manner as your previous life.

You tried to push that thought away, trying different distractions to forget it and to enjoy your life. However, it became harder and harder for you to ignore the possibility. Especially as you are the same age when you first died, when at the age of 27 you got in a car accident after leaving work. You realize that such a thing could happen as well, and feared that you would experience the same fate. You try to remember the same date as the first accident, believing it was a wednesday in April, which was next month. To try to change fate, en every wednesday in March you would call in sick or use a vacation day to stay out of work. You even tried taking public transportation or walked to avoid driving on other days. May came soon enough, and you realized you had potentially changed the fate of your life. You feel asleep on the last day of April, content you were still alive unlike your past life.

On the first day of May, you woke up in a strange room surrounded by equipment. You realized you were back in the hospital, having come out of a month long coma. You realized your new life was but a dream, something your mind conjured during the coma. You would soon be discharged the next day, and return to your original life. Your family and friends were relieved to see you alive and well, and you too were glad to see them again. You thought back to your own life and to the life you experienced in your coma, and you realized that despite all the hardships and struggles you experienced in both, you were quite grateful for the life you have had so far. Although you would always wondered if reincarnation was something that would happen to you when you would die, you also accepted the possibility that it didn't exist. You were motivated to live your current life to the fullest, feeling you had much more to experience and do in the remainder of your life.",36,1,27,0,8,12,8,4,1,7,0.0,0.75,0.2222222222222222,0.3896296296296296

You take this as an evasion for his and your own good, and get on the plane. Once aboard, you make a quick check of the amenities, and settle back in your comfy leather chair.

There were only 8 of us left. The last blast from the aliens destroyed much of the life on earth and the ones who were left were stranded on an island. e were all that was left to carry on the human race.
 The legend of the power called Mana was still shared but we thought it was gone forever. Then one by one, we began to see signs of that power returning.

We decided that we needed to get together and figure out what was going on.
 We gathered in a cave not far from where we lived. We thought maybe if we tried to glow together in the same space it would help us figure out what was going on and why we were glowing. So we all stood in this dark cave for nearly an hour and then slowly, one by one, we all began to glow in the dark, illuminating the cave. The glow grew stronger and brighter. There were bats in the cave and they all flew away from the bright light that we were producing. At that moment, we felt like we were glowing with the power of the Mana once again. When we stepped out of the cave, we were all glowing and continuing to glow brighter and stronger. 

The next day one by one, it was like we all remembered our instincts. This glowing WAS the Mana! and we knew we were invincible to harm with it. We were able to harness this from then on to protect us from hostile aliens wishing to attack. In the end what they did to our planet merely helped us survive. Even if it was only 8 of us.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, there are many benefits that come from using an audiobook. The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight.

You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version.

Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. 

I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with.

I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best.

I personally prefer my books to be audiobooks. I find the benefits really help me understand the book better than if I were to read it the traditional way. So audiobooks have really helped me in my life. Without them, I wouldn't ""read"" much at all.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, I would watch shows and movies with stereo typical characters because I feel that they are interesting and entertaining but I don't always agree with them. Sometimes it really adds flavor to the show, as well as high entertainment value. Now before you start calling me a bigot, or some kind of racist, let me explain. 
One of my favorite shows is ""FThe Big Bang Theory.
 If you look at that show, everyone of the characters in it portrays some form of a stereotype.  Sheldon Cooper is a stereotypical smart guy nerd who acts like a robot, the next one: Howard Wolowitz is a stereotypical Jewish American, as well as Rajesh Koothrappali, and Leonard Hofstadter all portray ""nerds"". They are all scientists, and that is a huge stereotype. Then you have Penny, who the stereo typical blonde girl next door that comes off as dumb and clueless.

As you can see that show is full of ""cringe"" worthy stereotypes, but that adds more to the flavor and humor of the show. That's what makes it worth watching. So I can not say I would not ever watch a show full of stereo typical type characters, because sometimes people take it to personally when it's not meant to be. It's just a show.

The United States was understandably angry. They have been essentially shunned from the rest of the world, while people have been able to communicate with one another. The current United States President, Michael Wilson, has been the subject of great controversy. His decision to declare an all out war in all of the countries of the world was not met with overall support, but in his mind, it was the best decision.

Military forces all around the country were moved into place, and would launch an attack on all other countries in the world. Nuclear weapons, conventional weapons, biological weapons, you name it. The United States have made them all ready and eager to use them upon the other countries.

Meanwhile, protests on different States have erupted as well as riots, and the President has been forced to declare martial law. ""This is immoral!,"" says one of the posters of one of the protesters. Another one says, ""I will not let this happen!,"" and yet another says that ""This is not the America I know!""

But President Wilson was not budging. He had his aides set up a tactical plan on who to strike first. They've attacked smaller countries first, such as Guatemala, Rwanda, and El Salvador. All populations of those small tiny island countries have been decimated within a few minutes as a result of the United States' attack. Next were mid-size countries like Poland, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Military troops of the United States have invaded these countries, and the majority of their populations have been wiped out within a day's time.

The countries with larger landmarks were last and were the hardest to conquer, but with the United States' nuclear weapons, they had no problem whatsoever. China's superpower tanks were no match for the United States' technology, and their entire population was wiped out within a few days as well. The United States' longtime rival, Russia, was no match for the United States either, and their population suffered a similar fate to China's.

The last remaining country, Canada, which was also a country that has always been friendly to the United States, was the final country to have been attacked by the United States. President Wilson had a visible frown on his face, and he turned to the camera and declared, ""Canada has been a close ally of ours for so long.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things a student should learn in school today are not at all the things I learned when I was in school. They are not even the same things I learned when I was in university. I don't know if my experience in school and university differed from other people, but I think students should be taught about the real world and about how to live a successful life while in high school. There should be classes about filing taxes, getting jobs, buying a house, paying bills; just general life things that people tend to have to figure out on their own. I think a focus on the time after graduation from high school should be emphasized more instead of just throwing the kids that graduate out into the world with no skills to help them. While it is important and sometimes fun to learn all sorts of sciences and history, peppering in some life skills wouldn't hurt too much.

The most important thing I learned in school for my life didn't even happen in high school. It wasn't until college that I learned some things that are valuable to my adult life. I learned about how to compose a proper resume for a variety of different job positions, which is a skill that everyone will need to do. We also went over general job interview strategies. These things certainly prepared me for my career after college. I think a lot of people who have graduated from high school don't know how to create a professional looking resume or how to properly conduct themselves in an interview so people who did not learn these things in college will be lost. I was surprised to find out that not many of my peers got the same interview knowledge I did in their classes. Something like that should be required for all students. Life lessons will be more important than knowing all of the organs in the digestive system for almost everyone. I really should have learned job skills like this when I was in high school, and not in college in an elective course.

But the little pig did not care as it was the smartest of the bunch and wanted to be different.  The wolf only told the pig that because he wanted to make it easier on himself in case he wanted to breakin and eat the pig, he is use to pigs building their houses from mud and some from straws. So the wolf started to convince the pig to break the house down and make it from straws. But the pig saw straight thru the wolf's intentions and did not stop the building of his uranium house. he wolf was very angry and he said, ""I am going to blow down your house with my huffing and puffing.""
 but that was what the wolf would tell all the pigs and believed it would work for this one , but as he huffed and puffed and tried nothing happened. He blew with all his might hoping something would break but it stood strong and tall and did not even budge. The wolf was very angry and said, ""I will blow you down with my dynamite."" The wolf went to town looking for some but could not find it, so he stood still and sat down on a bench and thought about what he could do. He thought and thought and then he had an idea. He went to the store and bought a can of gasoline and a box of matches. He thought wow this will make any house burn down and it does not matter if it is made from uranium or bricks. So he went to the pig's house and poured the gasoline all over the house and then lit a match and threw it on the house. The house caught on fire and burned down to the ground. The wolf was happy and went to town to tell everyone how he had burned down the house and the pig. The wolf was very proud of himself and he went to the bar and got drunk. The next day the wolf went to the pig's house and the pig was sitting on the ground crying. The pig told him that he had worked so hard to build his house and thought he was going to be in it forever and raise his family. The wolf ended up feeling sorry for the pig and regret burning his house down. The wolf said, ""I am sorry I burned your house down, I will make it up to you."" The pig said, ""okay, how?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a new house."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of house will you build me?"" The wolf said, ""I will build you a house made from bricks."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of bricks will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best bricks there are, the ones made from gold."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of gold will you use?"" The wolf said, ""I will use the best gold there is, the kind that is mined from the ground."" The pig said, ""okay, but what kind of ground will you mine it from?"" The wolf said, ""I will mine it from the ground that is made from uranium."" When the pig heard uranium he got super excited because then he would have the same house that was burned to the ground that he worked so hard to build . So the wolf and the pig went to the uranium mine and the wolf started to mine the uranium and the pig started to build his house. The wolf was very happy because he knew the pig was going to have a great house and he was going to get the uranium that he wanted. It took the wolf 19 days to build the house but when the house was finished it was the most beautiful house in the area and even more beautiful than the one the pig had built before. The pig was very happy and thanked the wolf endlessly .",43,6,15,12,10,24,23,1,1,22,0.27906976744186046,0.3488372093023256,0.5116279069767442,0.29316770186335406

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 
This is the story of the rebirth of magic in a world where it has long been forgotten.
  
The story is told through the eyes of the main character, a young man named Riku.
 He is the son of a powerful mage, and has been trained in the art of magic from a young age. He is the only one of his kind to have been born in a hundred years. 
The story begins when Riku is a young boy, and follows him as he grows up and learns to control his magic.
 He is sent to a school for mages, where he meets many other students his age. Very similar to Harry Potter and Hogwarts. Riku is a very quick learner and is the top of his class. 

His ability to learn magic is uncanny. He is able to learn spells that take others years to master in a matter of days. He is also able to cast spells that no one else can. He is a very powerful mage and has the potential to be the best mage of all time. 
Riku is also very skilled in the art of hand to hand combat.
 He is able to take on many enemies at once and defeat them with ease. Nobody can touch him. Except for one other student. Koru is the only other student who is learning the art of magic at the speed Riku is. However Koru is using magic to do harm. 

He is a very evil person and is the complete opposite of Riku. He is able to cast spells that Riku has never seen before. The two go into battle. Riku wants to save the world. Koru wants to take over the world. 
The story continues as Riku grows up and is forced to make decisions that will change the world forever.
 Koru gives Riku an ultimatum. Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.

Riku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.

Riku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world. A beautiful first chapter to this series. However in the next book a more powerful and more evil force will challenge Riku. Will Riku be up to the challenge or will evil triumph over good? For the sake of humanity lets hope good beats evil just like the cliche says.",41,3,24,0,14,18,14,4,2,12,0.0,0.5853658536585366,0.34146341463414637,0.44216417910447764

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It can be somewhat unnerving to realize that this is how the end of your life will turn out. Yet to be honest, this experience can also be a refreshing one.
In the movie, the characters are able to influence the events on the screen.
 They can change the plot of their life, and even alter their own fate. This means that in the movie, you might be able to resolve the issues that you had with the girl you got into a huge argument with and had a falling out with, or that guy you broke up with on bad terms, or that parent you had a bad relationship with that couldn't be fixed. 
When you die, you will have the opportunity to resolve all of these issues.
 You will be able to make amends with all of the people you have wronged, and you will be able to apologize to all of the people. And in doing so, you will be able to forge a new path for yourself. You will be able to come clean of your sins and you will be able to walk with much more confidence and pep as a result. 
If you have a lot of unresolved issues in your life, it is a good idea to start resolving them now.
 Of course the movie that will play at your life's end might be able to give you some sense of closure but it cannot necessarily be your fallback crutch. After all, the people you have hurt or wronged in your current life deserve an apology from you now, while you are still living in the moment. 
It is important to note that the movie that plays at your life's end is not necessarily a reflection of the life you have led.
 Sometimes the movie's portrayal of you will not be accurate and this is to be expected. After all, the movie is a reflection of your life as seen through the eyes of the people who were in your life. This means that the movie could in some ways be a bit distorted. You might feel betrayed in the way that some people view you and your life story, if others' perceptions don't align with your own. 
However, even if the movie is not an accurate portrayal of your life, it is still a good idea to watch it.
 This is because this exercise can be a hugely transformative experience. It is also a humbling one, as it's so rare to get an objective third party view of yourself. 
The movie that plays at your life's end is also a good opportunity to reflect on your life.. But the important thing to walk away with from this contemplation and reflection is that no one is perfect. No one who watches the movie of their life will ever feel that the events in their life unfolded absolutely perfectly. 
So if you are feeling a bit down about yourself and your life, it is important to remember that you are not alone.
 Don't feel that you have let yourself down or let others down. Also remember that any mistakes or flaws in the movie will be magnified. So don't beat yourself up about it.

In conclusion, take this opportunity to view the movie of your life as one that is valuable to understand yourself and to understand the world around you. 
This movie is a gift that you will be given when you die.
 Make sure to use the time that you are given with this gift in a way that is meaningful. This means that you should live your life in the present and make amends with people you hurt as soon as you can, before you reach the end of your life.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, people are more empathetic towards the suffering on animals compared to people because most animals are good. People do messed up things all the time. Murder, robbery, fights, drunk driving, so many negative things that humans do on a daily basis that makes people turn to animals.

A dog is known as man's best friend and that is for a reason. Dogs are loyal and are always there for us. Sometimes they are even more loyal than family and friends. I don't think this issue needs to be cut and dry. 

We can care about both humans and animals at the same time. I don't think it's wrong to focus on the welfare of animals when humans are suffering. I also don't think it's wrong to focus on the suffering of humans when animal cruelty is a thing.

We should be trying to solve both issues instead of prioritizing one more than the other. 

I'm also not surprised to hear that a majority of people found it more upsetting to hear about a dog being beaten by a baseball bat compared to a man. How is a dog supposed to defend itself against a baseball bat? A human can at least try to wrestle the bat away and grab it. A dog can't grab a baseball bat. A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios.

Animal cruelty is absolutely disgusting and someone that participates in it should be in jail for at least 10 years in my opinion. One of the cruelest things that you can do is hurt a defenseless animal. Those people are the lowest form of human. They're despicable.

In the future, lets do our best to take care of both humans and animals that are suffering. Doing so will make this world a much better place. ",28,7,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.454337899543379

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We can focus on both at the same time. We don't have to put all of our focus towards one topic. 

Animal cruelty is horrible just like cruelty against humans is horrible. No living thing should be harmed physically, mentally or spiritually by another living thing. 

But again, I think we can help animals and humans at the same time. We can rescue animals from shelters instead of buying them off breeders. We can help get rid of the drug problem that causes so much crime. 
I am not surprised to learn that humans are more empathetic towards animals compared to other humans. I think that probably stems from humans having more positive experiences with animals and more negative experiences with humans. 

There's news stories every single day that talk about all the horrible things that the human species does including murder, war, robbery, etc. That sours humans for a lot of us. While I personally believe that every human has some good in them, I know that many others don't feel that way at all. 

I think that many humans also consider their pets as part of their family. I know I do. If I saw my dog getting beaten by a baseball bat I'd do everything in my power to save him. If I saw another human getting beaten by a baseball bat, I'd also try to help. If I was forced to choose, I'd have to help my dog simply because I consider my dog to be family. I know many other people think that way too.

Dogs are the best. They aren't known as mans best friend for no reason. Most dogs are more loyal than most humans. That's a sad fact. As humans we should be doing everything we can do help end animal cruelty. An animal can't defend itself against a human in most cases and anyone that would harm an animal is a despicable person.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

Then the wolf went into the kitchen and came back with a tray full of snacks.  ""I thought you might be hungry,"" he said.

Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.  ""Frank,"" he said, ""are you going to eat me?""

  I'm not going to eat anyone.""

""But you're a wolf,"" the pig said.

The wolf asked the pig what he had eating while they watched tv together.  The pig thought a minute and then said, ""let's see, we had peanuts, a fruit salad, a bowl of popcorn and stir fry with tofu for dinner.""  

""That's right.  Did you notice that these foods have anything in common?""

he pig thought a minute and then said, ""they're all made of plants.""


The wolf nodded.

""You're a vegetarian.  You don't eat meat.""

""Correct,"" said the wolf.  ""Now, you need a place to stay and I can't pay the rent on this place myself, so how about it.  Do you want to be my roommate?""

However, the source of energy that once spanned the Earth that gave humans the ability to wield magic, Mana, had mysteriously vanished in the past. Today, most are unaware that humans had wielded magic in the past, as technology had replaced it and was now what modern civilization depended on. That is until, a group of explorers stumbled upon a mysterious temple, in the jungles of Central America.
The explorers were a group of scientists and archaeologists, who were studying the ancient ruins of the temple.
 They were not sure what was the purpose of the temple, but they were surprised to see that it was in good shape despite how ancient it appeared. The explorers decided to explore the temple, and were surprised to see that it was filled with strange artifacts. Upon examining the artifacts, they learned it was a form of written records, that detailed the energy source that other more modern texts referred to as Mana. The researches were pleased, they had found the oldest records on the planet that mentioned Mana, meaning that the people that built the temple could also tap into it to wield magic. 
The researches were excited to learn more about the ancient civilization that had built the temple, but they were surprised to find that the temple was
 far bigger than it appeared from the outside. They ventured deeper into the temple, taking note of its pristine design and craftsmanship. They ventured deeper, wondering to themselves if they should turn back, until they stumbled on the main chamber of the temple. In the main chamber was a large room with a massive stone slab in the middle of it. The stone slab appeared to be written in an ancient language, with some archeologists being able to translate it once they took a closer look at it. The translated text revealed that the slab was a record of the civilization that built the temple, and their discovery of Mana. The slab surprisingly, also detailed how Mana was created by the civilization. It revealed that the civilization had used Mana to create a powerful weapon, that they used to fight off a powerful enemy, that was not from this planet. The machine to create Mana was thus submerged into the ocean, so it would not fall into the wrong hands. What remaining Mana that was created, was mentioned by the slab would be temporary, and would eventually run out.
The explorers were shocked by the discovery, and decided to inform the world of their discovery.
 Thus several countries around the world took on many endeavors to scan the ocean for the ancient machine, in the hopes of creating more Mana. For many, the purpose may as well have been nefarious , as the Mana could be used to create powerful weapons. Others hoped it could be used as a cleaner and safer energy source to power the cities of the world. The search for the ancient machine was long and arduous, with many countries having to give up on the search. If the machine existed, it would be at the deepest parts of the ocean, far from the reach of modern humans.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The worst stereotypes are interracial relationships. If a black man is involved, the woman is either a cheater or there to serve as the black man's downfall. If a black woman is involved, the man is there for her to sleep with and get money from.   If it isn't like that, it is the black man who goes to jail and cheats on his white wife with a black ""sistah"" or is in some other way dramatically involved in a usual negative stereotype.

This is one of the reasons why Tyler Perry has cleaned up financially.  He has brought such amazing characters to the big screen that people are clamoring to see more of his romantic movies.  For interracial couples to be featured in books or movies, it doesn't have to be some lurid combination. It can be subtle and beautiful. People realize this, and are moving towards more accurate representation.
I'd like to see different kinds of relationships represented in more depth.
 Quirky, unique and different love stories need to be told. I'm tired of seeing only the 'usual suspects' time and again. I want to see strange couples and new stories.   

It's hard to watch/read about interracial relationships without feeling incredibly frustrated. Sometimes I think we'll never get to a place where interracial relationships are just about the relationship, not about the fact that the two people are of two different races.  It's been done very well a few times (one of my favorites is ""Empire""), but it doesn't happen enough for me. 
What irritates me is when people describe things and every time they describe the color of the person they go 'black/ brotherwhite, girl"" etc, instead of their personal story. It is such a tired, repetitive theme. I hate it. I can't even watch movies that give the black man a hot sister to meet as a hooker or some other profession like that, because it is just so lurid and tasteless.  just hate it.

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain. 
Another stereotype that I despise is the naive, innocent person.
 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream. I feel like she was the biggest weak character.  It was hard to watch her make all the mistakes she made. She was more blind than any of the characters in any horror movies I have ever watched. I kept thinking about how differently I would've acted if I were in her shoes.   I actually never finished the whole series. She was an example of a movie character that inspired me to become like the opposite.  That's one way to be inspired by bad movie characters.

On a piece of paper, the Main Character sketched out the story. There was childhood, romantic life, career, old age... Romantic life needed more. Much more. And the ending wasn't an ending at all. The Main Character scribbled some notes onto the sketch, and was ready for the next step. The Main Character traveled back to the part of the film with the love story. It wasn't a romance. It was too dull, too predictable. The Main Character would have to spice it up a little bit. She added new music to the scenes with the love interest. The melody was more complex. ""This will be more fun to watch.""

Now it was time to work on the ending. It was a happy ending, but it needed more. She looked back to the film shots of the love story, and the man, and how they danced together. She wrote a note on the paper. She spliced the film from the dance scene to the last day of her life. She wanted to end it all with a bang. It was ready. It was time to watch the New Film. 

The audience gathered again in the cinema. The Main Character sat down in her reclining chair and watched the New Film. The film began to play, and the audience members faces lit up with joy. The New Film was a masterpiece. The scenes with the love story were so romantic. When the film reached the end and she was about to pass onto heaven, the young man she danced with all those years ago was there waiting for her at heaven's door.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, online dating is a great way to quickly find partners that are more compatible with you then if you were just trying to find someone based on your much smaller social circle. You can find people with very specific interest that you can not find on your own. The sheer number of potential matches on dating sites far out numbers the amount of people you will consider dating in person by several orders of magnitude. Dating apps also have algorithms that help match you with potential partners that are very close to what you are looking for or how compatible you may potentially be with a person. These algorithms are highly effective. People are also looking at you. You will be contacted by potential partners as well. So its not just one way. Then you can get to know one another a bit before the first date if that is what you want to do. Given how many people are in need of dating or relationships or connections, its no surprise that online dating is very popular. It also does not have the stigma around it that it used to. I believe it is now the most efficient and smart way to choose a potential partner. Its much better then luck and that is usually all you have to work with when out in the world looking for love. On a dating app luck plays its part but not nearly as much. The the two of you can use your devices to get to know each other before and while dating.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 
The first novel in the Mana series, The Last Mage, is available now.
 It is a book that takes place in the 1800s. The main character is a young boy named Will who is a mage. It is his responsibility to fight off the witches that are trying to poison the Earth and all it's inhabitants. 

The witches fly on brooms and have the ability to cast spells onto any human they come into contact with. The witches' main goal is to kill all humans and take over the world.

However, Will is a boy that has superpowers. He has the ability to control the wind and the rain. He also has the ability to fly. He can make the conditions impossible for the witches to fly in. He can make it so windy that their brooms won't be able to be steered. 

Will decides to challenge the witches. He sees them flying out and about one day and gets into a battle with them. The witches fire spells at him and he used his ability to control the wind to dodge them.   He then uses his ability to control the rain to put out the fire that the witches are using to burn him.

Will and the witches go their separate ways and prepare for a final battle. Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.

The final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within it. He was seen as a hero. He saved humanity.

In my opinion, it is a tough decision on whether or not to pay student-athletes. The amount of money that each school makes widely varies, and if the schools that made the most money were able to pay their athletes more, it would just turn into a bidding war as far as recruiting goes. I think that the only realistic way to even talk about payment to athletes would be if the NCAA just made the payments to all the student-athletes by division, and gave them all a set amount of money. Either this, or they give out other non-monetary types of perks. What should not happen however, is these same student-athletes struggling to pay for their dorms, or barely having enough food to eat. I have heard so many stories of these well known players who could barely pay to survive in school. That makes absolutely no sense since they are helping provide tons of funds to the school they are at. I think the least they could do is make sure the student athletes all have plenty of food and no worry whatsoever on the cost of their rooms. This should be the minimum in my opinion. From there, yea we can talk about some sort of monetary payment. So i played college football at a division II school, and although we were division II, we were a top 10 team each year and actually made the championship and lost my senior year. I dont think the amount of money we generate is anywhere near the amount at a big college football school in division one, so of course the monetation would have to vary based off of this. Either way, i think it is acceptable for these student athletes to be paid. I just think it will be a tough process because this would mean that all student-athletes would want to be paid, or essentially any team or group on campus that contributes to the college making money. While it is a huge opportunity to begin with to play college sports, i do think the ncaa could do a much better job at providing for these students. As the prompt says, it is important to avoid the bidding war, and the only way you can do this is by paying a flat fee i would suppose to all the athletes in that division. This would however cause the schools who are making more money to contribute much more than the schools making a lower amount of money. But who knows maybe this would actually even out the competition for the schools, and end up in a much more fair recruitment process that goes more off of the school itself as opposed to just the team. So in conclusion, i think student athletes to have the right to be paid, however the ncaa is going to have to make sure they are very careful in the way they choose to go about doing this.",27,9,18,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.42442748091603055

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. To do so would serve to commercialize college sports and the value of a college education. Players on scholarship are offered free room and board, so a scholarship is essentially payment for their physical and mental commitment to the team and school. 

If they want an education, they attend college. If they want to focus on sports full time, they can go pro. If they want both, they can find the suitable balance. 

 believe the essential point is that college is not a job.
  The goal of education is to offer an environment where students are exposed to and encouraged to pursue interests and viewpoints that aren’t necessarily personally beneficial. College is the fine-tuning of your skills, the exposure to new ideas, before you begin the commitments and worrying of life as a complete adult. 
By paying athletes, the college experience would be cheapened.
  The value of a degree would drop, as graduates would essentially be viewed as professionals fulfilling their contractual obligation to the university (paying tuition and sitting through lectures). 

The rest of the student body, the non-athletes, while still receiving scholarship money, would be expected to earn an actual living in the ‘real world'.  This would be troublesome from many aspects. 

hose who don’t have a chance to play professionally are essentially cheated of this opportunity. to both ""earn and learn"" simultaneously. 
No other career path pays for attending college, so why should we single out athletes? hose students who do not have the athleticism to be a college athlete are punished for what they cannot do.
 

We should leave colleges as a sacred institution of learning...and let the unequal bartering of capitalistic professional teams begin once the students leave the door. ",26,9,5,0,12,27,13,14,6,7,0.0,0.19230769230769232,0.46153846153846156,0.5529157667386609

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion,  we should take the extra time on screens, and apply it positively. Technology is common place in most roles in humanity, unavoidable and all-encompassing. Screen time has many benefits, and we should stop worrying about it happening, and instead focus on how and what we do with it when it does happen.
We should use the extra time on screens to connect with people, to share information, and to help each other.
  e should use the extra time on screens to learn, to teach, and to share knowledge.
  We should use the extra time on screens to create, to make, and to share ourselves and our minds with others. 

There are many new ways to share, and modern technology makes this effortless. We can share our thoughts, our feelings, and our ideas with the world with a simple touch.  We can learn from others, gaining experience, insight, and ideas at a rate we've never before been able to.  We can connect with people we've never met, and learn from their lives. 

Technology is part of everyday life. We need to make the most of its benefits, and let it fall into its natural role in our lives. 
e need to embrace technology, and use it to help us.
  Change is inevitable, and stressing over it only wastes time and damages our health.  We're going to be using technology in the future, so we may as well begin to do it efficiently, without regrets.

As the alien had told him, te alien is trying to get home, but he's not sure how.


""But how am I suppose to help with that?"", replied Matt Damon. ""I'm an actor, not a scientist or an astronaut.""
""Well, you're the only person I know who's been to space and back, so I'm hoping you can help me,"" said

Matt Damon was thoroughly confused, wondering what the alien meant by that.

Suddenly the alien, pulled out a familiar DVD case, with his face on the front.

""This is you on this video correct, you were trapped on Mars and managed to make it back to Earth in this video,"" the alien stated with a gleam of hope in its five eyes.
""Yes, but that was just a movie,"" Matt Damon replied.
 He couldn't believe an alien would think his role in The Martian were what actually happened to him.

The alien looked puzzled, and confused at what Matt Damon said, evidently not knowing what a movie is.

Regardless, Matt Damon took pity on the alien and decided to humor his niavety. Telling the alien he would help him, Matt Damon decided to make some phone calls to some friends. He soon got in touch with famous astronomers, and physicists. Matt Damon orchestrated a meeting with top scientists at NASA, who were still in the dark for the real reason he decided to give them a visit.
Matt Damon and the alien met with the scientists at NASA, where they were given a tour of the facility. while the alien was disguised as a human. Near the end of the tour, Matt Damon met privately with rocket scientists, and revealed the identity of his friend.
""I know you guys are working on a way to get to Mars, and I was hoping you could help us,"" Matt Damon told the scientists

The alien shocked the scientists, who after being startled began analyzing and studying the alien up close.

""But think of the scientific discovery of a real life alien on Earth, "" one of the scientists proclaimed.
""I know, but he's not here to be studied, he's here to get home,"" Matt Damon replied.


Begrudgingly, the scientist agreed, realizing it was unethical to keep an alien against its will. They revealed a top secret project, a hi tech rocket ship that could make it to Mars faster than any other craft made on Earth, albeit a one way trip at the moment.
Matt Damon and the alien were given a tour of the ship, which was built to withstand the harsh conditions of space.
 To their suprise, the ship was ready to launch and could send the alien home in a couple of minutes.

With that, Matt Damon turned to the alien, and said his good byes. He wished him well, and thought to himself of what kind of family the alien had back home on Mars. he alien, in turn, thanked Matt Damon for everything he had done for him.
 Climbing into the ship, the alien was soon launched into the sky, while Matt Damon and the scientists viewed from the safety of the control room.

The technology they had developed was not enough to give them an edge, until one day, a civilization found how to harness an energy source present on the planet, called Mana. From that moment on, humans wielded mighty magical powers and abilities. They were able to thrive and survive on the planet, and flourished for thousands of years. That is until today, when it was found that the reserves of Mana had begun to diminish and disappear. It was found out by researches and scientists, with the common population of the world unaware of the tragedy that would befall the planet in due time.
TDespite efforts to hide the fact that Mana was soon to be depleted, word got out and soon spread among all communication channels of the world. hhe many cities and it citizens of the world depended on Mana, to power their homes and electronics, as all of human technology at that time used it as an energy source.

 They feared for their lives, and they feared a world without Mana that they would soon be living in. 
The world's leaders and scientists then began to work on a solution, to find a way to save the world from the impending doom.
 As chaos and panic rang all over the world, they looked into ways to replenish Mana and have it flowing all over the world to power the technology critical for modern civilization survival. They found out that the only way to do so was to have a source of Mana that was not from the planet, but from another world. It appeared that the Mana that flowed on the planet came from an asteroid, that had impacted the world and devastated the landscape. The Mana that flowed on the planet was a byproduct of the asteroid's impact, and if they could locate where the asteroid came from, perhaps they could find another source of Mana to use on the planet. 
The world's leaders then began to search for the source of the asteroid, and they found out that it chad broken off from a bigger asteroid in our solar system. The planet was within reach through current spacecraft, but it would take time for it to arrive on the asteroid and guide it closer to the planet. They then began to work on a plan to guide the asteroid to the planet, and they would use the last of the Mana on the planet to power the craft. They watched as the craft launched from the planet, as it left on its voyage to recover the asteroid. With hope in their hearts, the people of the planet hoped that the craft would be successful in their mission, and that Mana would once again be discovered. All they could do then is wait, to see if the craft would be successful in their mission, and if Mana would be found on the asteroid.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, dating apps and technology in general have paved the way to bridge closer connections together than ever before. Because of dating apps such as Tinder, Facebook , Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media platforms, people are able to connect with each other in ways that were not possible before. Imagine before where two strangers could only meet by chance on a particular instance, nowadays we are able to connect with people from all over the world. It's almost as if it's cheating to find the one and what most people call, your soulmate.

Of course being too distracted and neglecting to spend time with your loved ones if you use these dating apps too often can be a negative. But so is anything else that you do in excess. So the usage of technology must come with a great balance and moderation. This way, you can still enjoy the benefits of technology while still being able to maintain a healthy relationship with your significant other.

I remember being a kid and having no internet in the house, in order for me to contact a loved one that is far away is to write a letter and send it through snail mail. It was a slow, expensive, and a time consuming process. We almost take it for granted today that we can send a message to someone in another country in a matter of seconds that is also free of cost, considering you already have the equipment to do so. I feel like in the future, it would just be improved and we would all feel very connected more than less.

Being in a video call or a phone call, something may seem missing. It's not the same as being in person. Being intimate and feeling the touch of someone is still something that the technology can give. That's why I am optimistic that in the future, this can be improved and we can have a more intimate connection with each other. Having a device that lets you feel the touch of someone is something that I would like to see in the future. That way, there's no need for you to be in the same room as someone in order to feel their touch. This eliminates the issue of having to travel long distances just to see someone.

So just to clarify my stance with technology and dating apps, I feel like they are a bridge instead of a barrier. Using it in moderation, I feel like the tools the dating apps and social media provide is very useful and can help people connect with each other in ways that were not possible before. It is also actively trying to fulfill the further needs of humanity and making me optimistic that in the future, we will be able to have a more intimate connection with each other.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school has nothing to do with any sort of subjects or teachers. I think students should just focus on learning about themselves. When i say this, i mean to try different things and try different classes. Go to different get togethers, put yourself out there. I think high school in particular is the perfect place to take risks. You are still with your parents so you have a support system, and you have all of these different clubs and organizations you can join and participate in. You have an opportunity to make closer friends and mingle with people, and being with others is one of the best ways to learn about yourself.  think the most important thing i have learned in school is that i can do anything i set my mind to.
 I think anyone can do anything they set their mind to as long as they look at it the right way. If you do something everyday to contribute to your goal there is no way you can fail. Setting goals is so important, and high school is a great place to start. Whether you have athletic goals, or academic goals, a goal to get a boyfriend/girlfriend, a goal to be the leader of a club, etc. As long as you are doing something productive towards your goal, there is no way you fail. If you can shift your mind to take the positive out of any negative situation, it is a sure fire way to be happy in your life and learn from your mistakes. I think teenagers and kids in general need to take their mind and mental health so much more seriously, and learn how to control their thoughts and brain before their lives get to stressful. When you become an adult, there are so many more things you need to think about. If you dont know how to talk about your emotions and deal with them by the time you get older, it can be very difficult to do things like go after your goals or be helpful to other people. You need to help yourself before you can help others, and being aware of this as early as high school is a great way to continue to grow as a human. For me personally, knowing that i can achieve whatever goal i work at has impacted my life greatly. I am addicted to pursuing goals, and if i dont have one i feel empty. I played sports all my life, so that was something that always gave me a goal to work on. However, when i finished playing football in college, i realized that i needed to start and find goals outside of athletics. This led me to creating my own business and even getting into boxing, which yes is not outside of athletics, but is a huge challenge and mental challenge as well. To me, the main takeaway was simply to continue to take risks and improve myself. I realized that i need some sort of athletic in my life for its ability to calm my mind and body. Boxing was always something i wanted to get into but never had the chance since i played football year round. So in conclusion, i think the most important thing for someone to learn in school is simply themselves.",32,6,25,0,1,2,1,1,1,0,0.0,0.78125,0.03125,0.41961414790996787

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely had an impact on the dating process, but I cannot truly say that the impact has been negative.   

In general, I think that the impact has been positive because it has made dating more accessible to people who might not have had the opportunity to date in the past.  In the past, meeting someone and starting to date them was mostly just a question of luck.  One had to be in the right place, at the right time, and had to be physically attractive enough to catch the eye of a passing stranger.  While people complain about the swipe-right culture of online dating, I don't think this is any worse (or really, any different) than meeting strangers in public used to be.  But now, more people can put themselves out there, and have many more opportunities to meet others.
IAnothertbig impact that echnology has had on dating is that it has made it easier to find people who share your interests
.  In online-dating apps, you can quickly and easily read a short paragraph about someone's interests, and even search for specific interests and filter out things that you are opposed to.  In the past, you might meet an attractive stranger, start dating, and eventually realize that you have little or nothing in common.  This could lead to painful breakups in the worst case, and to wasted time in the best case.  Technology has saved us from both outcomes.  

In thc same way, tehnology has also made it easier to find people who share your values.
  People can reveal what they think is important right away, with a carefully written introduction.  It would be difficult to reveal these things to a stranger, or even to a blind date that a friend had tried to connect you with.  

While I think that online-dating has had the biggest impact, I can't ignore the impact that social media has had on the romantic scene.  However, I have to admit, that the impact it has had is not much different than that of online-dating.  One big advantage that social media has is that it helps us to discover people who are in our close network, but who we have simply not connected with yet.  This could be colleagues at work, or friends of friends at school.  There are many connections that might have slipped away in the offline world that can easily be made online.  

As for some other suggested topics such as texting and Netflix, I think that these are worthy of note, but not really game changers in their own right.  Texting is certainly an easier way to communicate than speaking over the phone, so maybe it helps potential romantic relationships to blossom.  It is another way to get an idea of someone's interests and values before you start dating them seriously.

I was also specifically asked about Netflix, and I think that it is also noteworthy, but not game-changing.  The infamous ""Netflix and Chill"" date that people talk about is certainly a relic of a new tech-focused world, but is really not much more than a date that ends in ""coffee"" at one's apartment.  It was just a polite way to invite someone over for what you assume will be an intimate encounter.  Netflix has merely provided an opening that some people may mutually exploit.

In conclusion, I think that the future of dating will continue to be technology-focused, and I think that this is ultimately a good thing.  It will benefit a lot of people, and the one's who think that it is excessive, are probably the ones who had no trouble finding dates in the offline world.",36,9,23,0,4,4,4,0,4,0,0.0,0.6388888888888888,0.1111111111111111,0.4171511627906977

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the main reason why extreme sports can be defined as a sport is for the same reason any other sport.  It is exciting and gives the participants a sense of competition and amusement. If there is no thrill or excitement, it might be considered a life-threatening activity rather than a sport. Climbing for fun, without the fun, is hanging wires, excavating, or doing any other monotonous job. 

Extreme outdoor pursuit activities such as mountain climbing and caving are the epitome of this. The difficulties of the climb, whether rock-climbing or mountain-climbing, or otherwise,  can make it even more thrilling and exciting. Exactly like other sports, the underlying reason why people participate in these activities is to have fun and challenge themselves. 

The adrenaline (fear/anger/happiness) rush experienced by the climber or caver makes it an attractive and highly rewarding activity. Many of these extreme sports also provide a sense of accomplishment, due mainly to the dangers faced in combination to the athleticism required.

All sports have risk. Some people just prefer to increase the risk difficulty. he extreme thrills and extreme dangers of outdoor activities are what make them both exciting and rewarding.
 If you take away the thrills and dangers, these sports would lose their reason to exist. 
Sports are competitive
. It is no question that almost all types of sports, including extreme outdoor pursuit athletes, are meant to compete with others. The thrill and adrenaline rush of winning, or the agony and suffering of defeat endured by competitors, leads to a sense of newfound perseverance and strength. 
Participating in these sports allows players to experience new feelings of excitement.
 This makes the sport addictive and people want to perform better and better, or push the boundaries further and further.

Extreme sports are just that. They are sports that follow all the criteria of regular sports: competition, personal athleticism, and risk, but do it to an extreme degree.  They are sports, but only for the bravest of the brave. ",25,5,6,3,11,15,15,0,1,14,0.12,0.24,0.56,0.5111111111111111

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads should be provided by schools, to be requeted by the student in the nurse's office. School offers meals to those living in poverty.  This is essentially the same thing. Pads and tampons are essential to a female student's essense. She does not need the embarrassing problem of being without protection. She does not need to stay home because she has no protection. She needs to concentrate on learning. 

Pads and tampons are called sanitary napkins for a reason. It is unsanitary to not prevent the spreading of blood. If by chance she emitted blood which could get on a seat, it becomes a health hazard. 

Who should pay for the pads? I think a government subsidy is the best thing to do, just like they do for meals. It would also be okay for PTA to make a contribution. I would imagine that local nonprofits might also be a resource for funding or the product itself.
PIn conclusion, pds and tampons should be treated the same as toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids.

---

In my opinion, schools should be providing these pads and tampons to female students. At the end of the day, all students should feel comfortable at school. If being able to receive tampons and pads is going to help female students, it should happen without any questions asked.

After all, school bathrooms are supplied with soap, toilet paper and paper towels. All of those are hygiene related products. Students that are boys don't have to worry about any of the embarrassment that could come from female students not having pads or tampons. 

At the very least, the female students voices should be heard. They're really the only ones that matter in this situation. If they say that they'll be more comfortable with free pads and tampons, they should be provided.

Someone would have to explain to me the negative aspect of these items being provided other than increased costs. I also can't imagine that the costs would be enough to make any significant dent in the amount that schools receive from the government via taxes.

The only difference between items like pads and tampons compared to items like toilet paper and soap is that there is a more embarrassing stigma surrounding the former. So my idea would be to have these items provided in a discreet way that wouldn't be embarrassing for the students. 

I think most families would support this as well because again, the students are children. They should be as comfortable as possible in school and I guarantee parents would want that as well. 

Lets just leave it up to the students. Let them have their voices being heard in an anonymous or discreet way in order to not embarrass them. If the students want this, it's the school and the governments job to deliver for them. That's the bottom line.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, a stereotype that makes me cringe because of how it may portray someone is the kid who gets bullied. The reason why i would say that it makes me cringe is because of how realistic it is in our lives today in regard to mental health. I just think about what it has to do to a kids mind being picked in everyday when they go to school. They dont even get a choice whether or not to go to school, it is the law that they be there in this structured environment. An environment where they can not even trust the officials to protect them from the emotional abuse. But not only the kid being bullied, i also think about the bully themself. What drives someone to bully a kid? They must have their own mental issues as well that may need to be tended to. I would say it hits me harder while watching a movie over reading a book. You can hear more introspective thoughts while reading a book. A movie, all you see is what is on the outside unless the character is narrating themselves. So the movie is closer to reality in my opinion for that reason. I wouldnt say that i cringe out of it seeming corny to me, or being uncomfortable. But mostly a cringe just due to the fact that it makes my mind go to the people who have lost their lives from overwhelmed kids doing things like school shootings and bombs, simply because they are having trouble controlling their minds and dealing with the stress that is put on them from either being bullied, family upbringing, etc. 

I dont think i would ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, unless it was blatantly trying to be racist to its audience or something like that. Normally when there is offensive portrayal of someone it is tied into the plot of the story.  If there were to be offensive portrayal of someone for no rythme or reason then it may be difficult for me to watch.  I just dont really understand or identify with that type of hateful mindset, so i would rather not watch it. I understand that people are brought up in certain ways, but to me it is almost like they are brainwashed to be hateful towards people who were born a certain way. I dont know, i guess i just dont understand it.  Other than that, i think stereotypes actually add more to books than what they could take away. They allow you to identify with characters and form deeper understandings of them. Also, they allow you to see people overcome their stereotype, and evolve as the story goes on just as people do in our reality.",26,4,21,0,1,4,1,3,0,1,0.0,0.8076923076923077,0.038461538461538464,0.44246031746031744

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, embrace it.  It has become a necessity so there is no point in having guilt, etc. about it.  At some point things will change and our behaviors will be more balanced.

Just think how up the creek without a paddle we would have been if we hadn't had the accessibility to screens and all the things they make possible.  Remote work would have been mostly impossible for many.  Online shopping impossible.  Keeping up with others would have involved long periods of delay and intimacy would have suffered.  Schooling would have been limited to what is in a book with no ready explanations or fun games to assist.   Doctor visits would have been only by phone with no opportunity for a more finely tuned diagnosis in many instances.

I think we are in a time of transition.  There should be and will be a balance as things normalize once again but screens are here to stay.  Perhaps we are just concerned about change, change in the way we work, relate to others, conduct ourselves.  Who among us has not just gussied up from the waist up for a Zoom call, skipping a shower and matching socks?  We need to establish new norms of behavior.  We need to be more flexible,  adaptable and accepting.

Instead of spending our time bemoaning the lack of in-person instruction we should be constructive and pro-active in seeking to make distance learning work for all.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports involve certain degree of danger, so no sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. But I admit that there are lines which should be drawn. Sports should only be played with the consent of every participant; players should have their physical and psychological states tested and certified by qualified specialists. In addition, if there is the possibility of serious injury, insurance should be provided and equipment should be maintained to minimize any harm. In most cases, these suggested conditions have been met satisfactorily, so I don't think that any sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. ports should also be conducted freely so that the players will have a sense of freedom.
 Instead of violating the principles of sport, I recommend that we should create education programs to increase awareness of sports and to teach players how to use their skills to prevent accidents in practice or competition. f it is their own choice to participate in a sport, why shouldn’t people be able to voluntarily take on additional  ?isk
 Because there are many risks in life, just as there are dangers in sport. However, even if the number of accidents is slightly higher than the number of accidents occurring in other activities, it's a valid idea for athletes to make their own choice. Why can’t the choice make all of those involved feel good? While it is understandable that people are concerned about the risk of injury in sport, shouldn’t we also have feelings about how exciting and attractive sports?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, it's not a good idea to pay athletes who are in college. A college scholarship is enough to pay them for putting in all that effort. They may bring money into the college but they can't be given even more unfair advantages. People will be looking at the college only for the players, not for the good education it offers. If college athletes are paid, they are more likely to be focused on playing rather than on getting an education. That's already an issue. So many athletes barely do any school work as it is. There doesn't need to be another factor that makes them even less likely to focus on their education.
Football, basketball players are paid when they are in the professional league.
 They'll possibly be making millions of dollars per year. They don't need to be paid any sooner than that. It's basically like saying we should start paying people who are in medical school in advance before they become doctors. They save lives. If they aren't getting paid then why should people who just play a game?

No one should take the focus away from education. Still, many people believe that paying athletes would be a good idea. They claim that it would bring more money into colleges while making the players more satisfied. That's probably true, but at what cost? The integrity of colleges is too important. Colleges depend on athletics to bring in a lot of money. That's a problem they need to resolve without forcing themselves to rely on athletics even more than before. Digging a deeper hole isn't going to get you out of it. It will only make it worse.

It's a bad idea to pay athletes. It hurts everyone except the athletes themselves and they already get enough special treatment. They have a lot of privileges. Colleges should instead focus their time on trying to find ways not to rely on college sports to bring in money. That's the real issue to overcome.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

Morgan woke up that morning, listening to the sounds of the bunker as she drifted back into consciousness. The steady hum of the power generators, the quiet conversation of her fellow survivors, and a familiar loping thump as Herman ran by outside. It seemed like just any other day.

Something he said was like a really strong tingle, but didn't hurt. And then an alien scout ship found them, and they thought they were all going to die. Right up to the moment the kid suddenly shot...something from his palms and blew the aliens all straight to hell. 
From there it was a mad dash back to the bunker, followed by days of hushed talk and whispered rumors.
 The kid could do things now, but he had almost no control over them. And people started talking about the old books, how all the little tricks people could do - light a candle, make a gift invisible, etc. - used to be real powers. So other people started touching the stone. And they started feeling things too. Some just felt things, others could make fire, and so on. Today was Morgan's turn.

Whatever the reason, Morgan was grateful not to have to worry about any other distractions. She ignored the one observer in the room, and walked straight to the stone. She didn't even need to touch it - the feeling was already coming. She reached out with her damaged arm, and a ghostly image of her former hand appeared. The stone suddenly glowed brightly as her hand connected, and a pulse of light flowed out. It spread through the entire bunker, and beyond. So far beyond. Yes, today was different.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

I do listen to audiobooks every now and then, but I find myself often preferring to read the book itself, based on the factors that are associated with reading versus listening. When people choose to listen to audiobooks, there are advantages and disadvantages that come with the process. Advantages include the ease of listening in comparison to reading, as naturally humans expend less energy and mental processes in listening, than they do for reading. Hearing an audiobook can be done concurrently with other tasks, such as household chores or driving. It is difficult if not dangerous to read while doing other types of tasks that require a person's full attention, specifically their vision as opposed to their hearing.  Disadvantages to audiobook relate to the format itself, how people listen to said audiobook. Listeners are potentially less engaged with the book, and are more likely to be distracted by outside stimuli when they are listening to a book than when they are reading the book themselves. In addition, their interest in an audiobook stems primarily on how the narrator reads the book, as opposed to how a person reads the book itself. A person might disagree with how the narrator paces themself in dictating the story, and or perhaps they find their tone and voice boring and uninteresting to listen to. Reading does not have such drawbacks, as people are free to voice and imagine the characters as they see suitable, and or can even pace themselves to read certain portions of the books slower or faster based on interest. It is also critical to consider that audiobooks requires the use of technology and digital storage, which is not easily affordable or available to many. This may barr them from using audiobooks, and reading physical media or even digital books might be a more economical and practical solution.

In the end, there are considerations a person must take when deciding to listen to an audiobook, or read it instead. These are affected by the personal interests of said person, along with other factors such as finances, the narrator, and availability of audiobooks versus the literature itself in a physical or digital format. I personally tend to gravitate towards reading, given that I enjoy the act of doing so, and find myself more engaged if I read the books as opposed to listening to someone else read the story for me. I do however appreciate how audiobooks are available to me, in my interests, and I enjoy them from time to time. I still believe that others must ultimately decide whether to use audiobooks or to read the books themselves, and that both should be easily available and affordable for people to make that choice in their daily lives.",23,7,11,0,5,7,5,2,3,2,0.0,0.4782608695652174,0.21739130434782608,0.4396039603960396

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is an obligation of each person in a democracy.  Not just the political news either.  We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our communities and the rest of the world. In an ideal situation, we would all be actively contributing to the betterment of our countries and globally. 

The reason I think this is because only when everyone is engaged, can we feel a real positive change.  We all have a responsibility to each other and unless we are aware of what is happening we cannot fulfill that responsibility.

Sure you can stick your head in the sand and care only about yourself and your circumstances and then complain if things aren't the way you like them but you then have nobody to blame but yourself.  Only by participating can we find solutions and prevent problems.  The idea that people on an individual level have no power is nonsense and nothing demonstrates that better than the last U.S. presidential election.  hen I think of the power behind people coming together, I think of this:.

One of the reasons that we have such a crisis in our environmental matters, in my opinion, is that people have forgotten the power of each individual.  Or, perhaps, we have been too lazy to exercise it.  hen we want something, we have to speak up.
  When we want something done we have to do something.  

Each of us needs to engage.  Engagement on the local level can have far-reaching impacts.   We have to be involved.  That is why I engage with the news on a daily basis and then I make my voice heard whether it is through action or words.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it's a free country so one is free to do whatever they so choose, so long as it's legal. And I've never heard of any laws against mountain climbing, snowboarding, or any other adventure sport. In fact, I just read up on some laws lately and I didn't see any that forbade such activities. And I should know a good bit about the law, because I'm a law student at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
That said, mountain climbers, snowboarders and pretty much anybody who's into the extreme sports scene has to be aware of one thing:
 they're not invulnerable. And the more extreme the sport, the more likely there will be accidents and injuries. But as long as the athletes themselves are aware of the risks, there's no reason why they shouldn't engage in such activities. After all, isn't living life to the fullest what being alive is all about? And don't we all take calculated risks, even for some very dangerous activities, like speeding on the freeway or crossing the street without looking one hundred percent both ways? One could even say that extreme mountain climbing is much safer than riding an inner city school bus! I mean, I get why that's a hyperbole but you know what I mean. 
It's an individual's decision to risk his or her life; strict liability is what tort professors always say.
 And the same goes for the parents of extreme sports enthusiasts. My parents never discouraged me from snowy excursions because they knew I was capable of making my own choices, and it's really none of their business anyways. I was admittedly fortunate that I never got hurt very badly; I broke my nose once, but nothing major. My tort professor would be proud of my astute choice of body parts to be injured by!

In law school, they teach us that if you're aware of the risk, you're considered to have consented to it. I don't really think anyone in the U.S. really wants to live in a country where the state is paternalistic enough to put the kibosh on our hobbies, but I digress. I mean, look at the amount of people who start smoking, despite the government's strong anti-smoking campaigns. 
The bottom line is that people should do whatever they want as long as they don't infringe on anybody else's rights.
 And I don't see how one can infringe on anyone else's rights by doing extreme sports. I suppose if one injured another's property somehow, they could be in court, but that's a different story. In the alternative, I suppose one could argue that extreme sports are not productive, but this is hardly an argument against extreme sports; I mean everybody does things that aren't necessarily productive. I just don't think that the inherent danger of extreme sports justifies their prohibition. It's not reasonable to prohibit them because they're too dangerous. It's much easier to prohibit dangerous things that could adversely affect innocent others, like drunk driving. But here, it's just the athlete hurting himself.

So in conclusion, I think that extreme sports enthusiasts should be entitled to pursue their hobby without fear of persecution based on the inherent risk present in such participation. But let it be clear that I am not supporting anything that violates any laws, of which I am aware no such laws exist. And of course, safety measures should be taken, because there are still risks to be aware of. And I'm quite sure my tort professor would be proud of my argument against the conclusions of social activists who think extreme sports are too dangerous. They can stay home in their granny panties.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is human nature to care more about the welfare of something helpless than something we perceive as being capable.  Human beings will almost always help a child before an adult due to that instinct.  We perceive animals in the same light, helpless and innocent.

Is it right?  That is a question that the 'animal movement' says a resounding 'yes' to.  There is a huge movement to wean us from eating animal products.  There are movements to ban the 'ownership' of pets.  There are movements to grant animals 'rights'.  It is not surprising someone would choose their pet over a stranger because that pet is part of a family unit and a human stranger is not.

hat is the Difference Between a Human and an Animal?
  Humans are animals.  We believe we are the apex of the animal world.  We may well be wrong.  Whales and other marine life have shown signs of intelligence approaching that of humans.  Primates are very human-like and in some ways superior.  It is not a stretch to believe that we are not the only intelligent life on this planet and we all have a right to a reasonable life.  

It's a thorny dilemma and is much debated.  The issues are important and the results will be far-reaching in our culture. ",24,7,14,0,3,9,3,6,3,0,0.0,0.5833333333333334,0.125,0.5337423312883436

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

The most important thing I learned in school was how to think. That may sound strange, but thinking is a skill not everyone has. Many people viscerally react, trusting their instincts or emotions, rather than carefully and rationally choosing between alternatives.
BWat iare he alternative sto making careful, rational decisions?
 Addiction, poverty, illness, and conflict all come to mind. All result from choices the individual made, and can either be based upon his emotional state at the time or else his rational thought.

Take cocaine. I may know its bad. I may know it is expensive. And I may know it has been the ruin of many, causing poverty, imprisonment, divorce, addiction, heart problems and death. So if someone offers me a ""toot"" of the ""white lady"" or ""yayo"" I do not in any sense think of it as a good thing because my mind knows the consequences. But if I act from my gut--if I am bored, say, or angry--one sniff can lean to decades of misery for me and my loved ones.
BBut, bcause I have spent my life learning to think, I can overcome my emotions in the presence of the drug and recognize that it is not worth
 it, and absent myself from any temptation.

In that case, leaning how to think can save my life. This is true for all decisions, large and small. Behind every decision to enter college, get married, or change professions is a series of decisions about what we value and how best to achieve our goals.

So if you've been a victim of rash decision making, try this handy trick. Wait for 24 hours before acting on an impulse. Give your mind a chance to consider it. The odds are your decision-making will improve a great deal.

Try it and see! You'll be glad you did.",27,6,16,1,4,9,5,4,3,2,0.037037037037037035,0.5925925925925926,0.18518518518518517,0.6016042780748663

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans healthier and happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other people or animals.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" ""There are so many pigs to eat, and they make it so easy!"" But the wolf didn't know about uranium. 

Of course, the little pig was smart. He knew he couldn't live in the house, since the uranium would poison him. So he built a big wall around it, and he lived in a little shack, hidden on the other side of the wall. Inside the decoy house though, he build robot pigs, to lure the wolf in. Once the wolf was gone, the little pig surmised, Mama Pig could relax and enjoy life. She had worked hard, and deserved to spend time with her thousands of grandchildren.  He devoted his time perfecting the fake house to get rid of the wolf, permanently. 
The wolf came, to the fake house one day and the robot pigs were like, ""We're so glad you're here, we've been waiting for you!
 Come in, come in!"" The wolf drooled hungerly. ""Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so hungry, I've been eating rocks and sticks and stuff."" And the robot pigs responded, ""Oh, we have a great feast for you! We've been cooking for days!"" 
So the wolf went inside, and the little pig closed the door. with a remote.   The wolf was like, ""Hey, what's going on? Where's the food?""

Ben Rhodes was a trusted friend, that he used to work for him in the White House. Ben Rhodes was a very smart guy, who understood politics and policy, but was a bit eccentric in regard to certain topics and ideas that he learned about. The email showed a certain urgency to it, so Obama read it immediately. Obama was shocked to learn that Ben wrote that he was soon to be in danger, and that he needed to be moved to a safe house. Ben also wrote in his email urging Obama to do the same. The email never disclosed the reason for this warning, but Obama knew that something serious must be going on to make Ben so nervous.

Obama spent the next minutes pondering his next course of action. He knew that he was not safe in his current place of residence, and he had made no plans for another place to go. He then remembered there was a nearby presidential safe house that was to be used for such emergencies only, but he had not used it while during his presidency. Grabbing some essential items, he then left the house and went to the safe house. Not wanting to scare his family and friends nor place them in any danger, he didn't inform anyone that he was going into hiding for the time being.
After arriving at the safe house, Obama settled in and began to watch the news and social media in order to get a better idea of what
 was going on. He could not find anything that suggested his life was in danger, and he began to ponder if he was being too paranoid. It was a possibility he thought, that he wasn't in danger, and that Ben was simply wrong that their lives were in danger. But something inside him told him that Ben was right, and so he settled in for a long time. After a while, he received a text from an unmarked number. The text simply read to ""Sit tight for now; you're fine.""

Wondering if it was from Ben, Obama felt a bit more relieved that he made the right choice. In the safe house, he was safe from any danger that currently threatened his life, even if he didn't know what that may be. The safe house was well stocked on basic necessities, so he didn't have to worry about food or water for the next days, but he still wondered when it would be safe to exit the safe house. Five days later he would get a more definitive answer on what was going on, as the news reported that certain US politicians were being targeted and killed. Realizing his friend was right, and that he was potentially a target, he felt relieved he had chosen to hide out at the safe house. 
After a few days, the news reports began to calm down, and it seemed that things were going back to normal.
 Those responsible were apprehended and would face legal justice. Obama left the safe house and returned home to his worried family. His wife and kids were relieved to see him safe, and they all hugged him. He got into contact with Ben Rhodes, who was glad to see he followed his instructions. The next few days were uneventful, and Obama and his family were back to living their lives as they normally would. Obama was very happy that he was alive, and began to write more on his memoir.

 You're colorblind, so you can't really tell the color of his shirt and tie for certain, but it is definitely a bright color. He smiles at you, showing off his perfect white teeth. 

""Hello son. I've come to take you home. It's time you took up your royal duties."" 
You look at him, confused.
 Son? As in he is claiming to be your father? Your mother never mentioned your father, or rather, she said he was a short, foreign romance and the man had left in the night to go back to his home and that was it. 
""I'm sorry sir, but you must have the wrong house.
"" You start, because surely your father wouldn't appear like this, after 18 years. 

""No my boy, it has just taken me a while to find you, and then reach you through your mother's interference. But I am here now, and by the agreement she and I made, you are to come with me.""

Your mother came running up the, ""No, please tell me you haven't spoken with him!""

But it was too late, and your fate was sealed. She told you the whole story then; how she had fallen in love with the bee king in human form, and agreed to have his child, and even agreed that the child could be the bee prince. SHe hadn't realized she would not be allowed to join you. So just before you were born she ran away and hid, and had been trying to keep you away ever since. But the agreement was binding; you had to go.
You are taken to the hive,
 ""This is one of my palaces on the edge of my kingdom."" said your father. Suddenly he changed into a bee, a large, truly majestic looking one. ""Soon we will enter the main kingdom, but you you must be made presentable. Change immediately into your true form - that of the majestic bee!""

""I don't know what you are talking about; I can't transform, certainly not into a bee!"" 
""You are a bee, you are my son, you must transform!""
 Suddenly a host of bees swarmed around you. Then one approached the Bee King. ""I think it is true your Majesty, we sense no bee in him. I do not think he can transform.""

The King raged. ""No son of mine is human!"" He ordered his guards to attack you! 
You were not a fighter, and you were outnumbered.
 But then you remembered; you still had the can of bee spray in your hand! You started spraying all around you, spinning. 

""Your Majesty we must retreat!"" squeaked one bee as it fell. The king buzzed angrily. ""I denounce you, you are no son of mine and an enemy of bees forever!""

And with that you returned home, and told your mother the story. She wept with happiness, and you both began planning your new life. THe first thing you needed to do was move somewhere without bees.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I dislike the portrayal of the ""evil"" stepmother in fairy tales. I think it is one of the worst villains in literature. This character requires a fundamental type of cruelty that is hard for someone like me to understand. I can't imagine being so cruel to someone else's child. It makes this villain one of the worst stereotypes.  This is probably what makes them so interesting in a story though. They are so evil that they are fascinating. And they give the story lots of ups and downs and twists and turns. Their evil nature and undertakings make the main character so much more likable.  The good versus evil theme is prevalent in most stories. It is what makes the story interesting. Still it is very hard to watch a story that centers around family abuse. It is hard to watch a story that centers around abuse of any kind. I think that is why I don't like the portrayal of the evil stepmother.

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. It's sort of a thrill to you, because you had no idea that you would be reincarnated as a white woman named Soeurette in your next life.

After all, you've always thought of yourself as a black man with a football player's build so it's a little odd to you that in your future life you're going to have long blonde hair, green eyes, and a thin, petite body. Soeurette is a very attractive woman, and she's unfortunately not a very nice person. She's a spoiled brat who is always looking for a way to get her way. 
She's also a very jealous person.
 Her fiance, Matt, is a nice guy, but Soeurette is always finding ways to make him jealous. For example, on her bachelorette party to Cartagena, Soeurette is out with her friends and she meets a guy named Carlos. She flirts with him and goes to his hotel room with him. And in the hotel room, she makes out with him and then she tells him that she's engaged to be married to a man named Matt. This only turns Carlos on more, because he's a man who likes to have his way with women who are already taken. So, the two of them spend the night together. They don't just kiss, they go further than that.

The next morning, Soeurette goes back to her hotel room and her friends ask her if she had a good time. Soeurette responds that she had a great time. She doesn't feel guilty about it at all. But the thing is, is that Carlos posts pictures of their encounter on Facebook, and Matt sees them. Matt is very upset by this, and he confronts Soeurette about it. Soeurette tells him that he has no right to be upset, because she's not his wife yet.

That kind of thinking is obviously not going to lead to a happy marriage, but Soeurette doesn't care. Upon realizing how selfish and shallow Soeurette is, Matt breaks off the engagement. Soeurette is devastated, and she goes to her father, who is a very wealthy man, and asks him for money so that she can go to Cartagena again to see Carlos. Her father gives her the money, and Soeurette goes back to Cartagena. It's too bad, though, because Carlos has already moved on and he's not interested in Soeurette anymore. In fact, when she arrives in Cartagena, he's already got another girl with him, and he announces that she is his new girlfriend.

Soeurette thus realizes she's going to have to pay for her actions. She is now alone. She doesn't have Matt anymore and she doesn't have Carlos. She's going to have to live the rest of her life without a man. This is not going to bode well for her, because she's a very materialistic person. She's used to having all the things she wants. Soeurette ends up committing suicide, and she's reincarnated as a man named Pierre. The movie cuts out to black as Soeurette takes her last breaths, and then it cuts to Pierre's life. You watch, sitting at the edge of your seat, as Soeurette is forced to reconcile with her actions one final time. ",35,2,11,0,22,52,29,23,0,29,0.0,0.3142857142857143,0.6285714285714286,0.42

He was kidnapping as he was still driving his car, which was also take in by the alien spacecraft. Nobody could confirm that this was an alien abduction, because there were no witnesses, and Matt Damon had not been able to call for help from his cell phone.

Once on the spaceship, Matt Damon came face to face with its alien driver. The alien began to speak, in an unknown language that he could not perceive. Even its appearance was indescribable, not resembling anything that lived on the planet. Matt Damon was confused, and because of the lack of a common language to communicate with each other, he decided to interpret the alien's words by moving. The alien appeared to be calm, not seemingly angry or threatening. It soon began to move, beckoning Matt Damon to follow it wherever it was heading. 
Matt Damon was brought to other aliens, who seemed to have the same features as their driver.
 They all huddled together, and began speaking in the same unknown language. Matt Damon began fearing for his life, thinking that he would never see his family or friends again. Suddenly, the aliens all stopped and faced him. One walked forward, and to his surprise, began speaking in English.

""You are the actor called Matt Damon, correct?"", spoke the alien in an accent that sounded unlike any he had ever heard on Earth.  
""Y...yes..."", stuttered Matt Damon.
 The aliens upon hearing his response, began talking to one another again, seemingly excited by his response.

""You were Jason Bourne in the Bourne series, and also the lead actor of The Martian, correct?"", the English speaking alien asked inquisitively.
""Yes, I was the lead actor of those movies"", Matt Damon replied., albeit confused why the aliens were asking him such a question.

The alien who spoke English then took out a odd device and in a blight flash of light, appeared to take a picture of him among the other aliens. 

"" We would also like your autograph,"" asked the alien, in which Matt Damon only nodded in agreement to such a request.

Once he signed several autographs for the aliens, they took him back to his car, and soon dropped him back onto Earth, on the same road he was abducted from. Albeit confused by the ordeal, he drove back home and went to see his family. Choosing not to worry them about the truth, he made up a lie stating he was stuck in traffic, and resumed the remainder of his day. For he was a bit content of the odd ordeal he was in a couple of hours ago, he learned he not only had fans on Earth, but he was also a famous actor amongst the aliens that lived in outer space.

For the third time this year, Matt Damon was missing. A few months back the last time this happened, the entire world basically stopped and searched for him. Come to find out he fell asleep on his yacht and floated out into the middle of the Pacific ocean for three months. So of course, when he disappeared this time, the entire world searched for him again. They checked the oceans and the coffee bars as well as small indigenous villages in South America where someone could go and just be out of the public eye for a while.  fter three months of searching, not a single lead was found.
 Then the big break came. NASA scientists discovered a tracking anomaly about the time that Damon went missing in the same area that he had last been seen. The anomaly was very interesting in that it appeared to be traveling at a speed that would take it all the way into outer space. After a few days of intense investigation from looking at radar images to doorbell cameras their worst fears were realized. Matt Damon had been kidnapped by aliens.
""So why would they kidnap Matt Damon?"" asked the president.
 That was the question everyone else was asking, too. So NASA set up a broadcast to beam into space to see if we could get an answer. The message that was basically 'Anyone with any information on the abduction of an Earthling with a slight Bostonian accent and charming sneer, please contact us' was sent out between all of our satellites as far as we could beam it. The response was almost immediate. 'We have Matt Damon. We need to be entertained. You cannot have him back.""
""We have to think of a plan,"" said the president, ""but why do they need to be entertained?""
 Once again this question was on everyone's mind. All we wanted was Matt Damon back. Is there anyone else that could entertain these aliens? ""Maybe we could ask the aliens to make a list of their favorite Earth entertainers,"" said the president. We could rotate them out like they were on tour. It would also keep the aliens from getting bored by the same actor.
Everyone agreed that this was a good idea and we started on our list of possible entertainers.
 There were several that actually volunteered. The list was narrowed down to twenty and sent to the aliens for their selections. They ended up trading Damon back to earth for a rotation of Bradley Cooper, Beyonce, and Celine Dion. The main thing was we had Matt Damon back.

All that mattered to me were the kids knowing that i was there for them. Knowing that i would do whatever they needed me for. All this mug was doing was making me question myself, but maybe that is why I am #1. Maybe I am because i am my toughest critic. Maybe I am because i am selfless and just want to make others happy.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I think, for example, that high-risk sports like extreme mountain climbing are inherently selfish and should not be indulged. xtreme mountain climbing, like other sports that carry with them excessive danger, such as riding motorcycles without a helmet and handguns without a proper license,
 are too dangerous to be pursued as a sport. 
Before we examine these activities which are dangerous, let's define sport.
 Merriam-Webster defines ""sport"" as ""exercise intended to delight or amuse,"" and ""a game played according to the rules"". In other words, sport is something that is done for the enjoyment of doing it. Extreme mountain climbing is not, of course, an activity undertaken for enjoyment - it is undertaken for the purpose of, well, climbing mountains. This is quite a different matter from taking part in sports like running, swimming, cycling and volleyball. n these kinds of sports, people can stay healthy wand pretty safe hile working-out.
 Extreme mountain climbing, on the other hand, is akin to playing Russian roulette. eople who practice extreme mountain climbing hurt themselves,and others, if they are not experienced and adequately trained.
 The statistical probability of sustaining a serious injury is very high if one decides to climb a very high mountain without proper mountaineering accouterments. Moreover, in extreme mountain climbing, there is not often a well-trained support staff to help climbers in trouble. Considering all these factors, I conclude that some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. ",18,5,1,0,12,13,12,1,3,9,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.6666666666666666,0.5555555555555556

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

The idea that people have a duty to follow the news presupposes that anything would be different about the country if they do. No doubt it will change some people's political views, but that is not something that affects the country. Because the people who have power are going to make sure they stay in power no matter what you think or how you vote. 

Remember the 2000 election and how that turned out. Gore clearly won, but the election eventually turned on Republicans in suits descending on vote-counting taking place in Florida. The Supreme Court handed the presidency to George W. Bush in spite of him losing, because the powerful few wanted a war in the Mideast, which is what they eventually got.

Why do red states have more political power than the blue states although they contain far less people? Because it's not about red and blue, it's about the Republican powerful getting what they want. They own the votes in the electoral college and they own the Supreme Court. The rest of the nation doesn't stand a chance, no matter how well-informed they think they are.

The last election showed how this works. Biden won, but Trump and his acolytes were almost able to reverse the election through lies, manipulation, and finding Republican Senators who were willing to refuse to certify electors in spite of what the constitution says. Were it not for a Washington riot which disrupted their plans, Trump would be dictator today.
This this is the real news that people need to know about.
 They need to know how the government really works. It works by a small number of people making sure that whatever the voters want doesn't make any difference.",21,6,6,1,8,12,9,3,6,3,0.047619047619047616,0.2857142857142857,0.42857142857142855,0.5361111111111111

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, we should absolutely pay college athletes. Why on earth shouldn’t they be compensated for what they are doing for the school? The truth is that the entire system of college sports is built on exploitation that is connected to a broader exploitative system. The universities profit greatly from these athletes who, in many cases, are putting their health on the line. There is also the possibility that young people are sustaining long-term damage from participating in sports. Some might point out that some of these athletes are receiving scholarships in return for playing and therefore getting a free education. This argument only highlights the broader exploitation at play. College tuitions themselves are greatly inflated in the US. The revenue that the schools are accruing from these young athletes is far greater that any loss from the exorbitant tuition fees. And even when you allow that these students are getting a free education, why should it be at the expense of some other young person? We put an emphasis on skills on the field when that player may have taken the place of an aspiring scientist. In summary if the schools must be allowed to exploit young athletes in this way they should, at the very least, pay them for their efforts.

One day, she meets a man who’s everything she’s ever wanted. She’s certain he’s the one, but she’s also certain she’s going to lose him. She has had relationships like that in the past. She gets so close to someone and then something happens where they drift apart and she gets her heart broken. 
She’s determined to not let that happen again.
 She’s going to hold on to this one. He's going to be the one. She knows it based off the first time she saw him. He was in a bar, and she was with her friends. He was so handsome, and he was staring at her. She felt it deep within her soul. She had to make a move. She told her friends she had to go to the bathroom and instead veered off and went up to the man to introduce herself.

The man offered to buy her a drink and the two had a conversation that went pretty well. The man was interesting and told her that he was single and left her his number. She was so excited. She was going to call him and see what he was doing next Friday night. She called the man and asked if he was free Friday and he said he was. She took control and asked the man if he wanted to go to a movie. The man was fine with that and told her he couldn't wait to see her.

Friday had arrived and the two met at the movies. They saw a very romantic movie and even held hands. The man ended up driving the woman home and gave her a good night kiss. The woman was melting inside at the idea that she finally had found a man that was as interested in her as she was in him. 
The two continued to date and the woman was so happy.
 She had finally found the man she was looking for. The issue for her is the man was not who she thought he was. He would go to bars and flirt with girls all the time. He would go on dates and sweep women off their feet and then break their hearts. He wasn't a man who was willing to commit. He just liked to play the game.

The woman found that out the hard way. She thought things were going perfectly until she saw him in a bar making out with another girl. She confronted him and broke things off and was distraught. She had finally found the man she was looking for and he was a player. She was so upset that she went to a different bar and got drunk. She was so upset that she didn't even notice the man who was sitting at the bar watching her.

 He couldn't help but feel bad for her. He wanted to go over and talk to her, but he didn't want to come off as a creep. He wanted to help her feel better. He went up to her and offered to take her home. She was inebriated and agreed which could have been dangerous. Luckily, the man was a good man and took her home. He left her his number.

The next day the woman woke up and saw that number and had no idea what happened. She called that person and he explained to her what happened. He asked her if they could meet up and she agreed. She wanted to meet a man who comforted her at her most vulnerable. A full year went by and they got along, dated and the man ended up proposing to her. They are scheduled to marry in about 4 months.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, I do not think it is selfish at all to pursue extreme sports like mountain climbing at all. That is because I feel that a person should be able to pursue whatever it is they like, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else in the process.

Most extreme sports also have that sense of teamwork and comraderies as well. For example , when people do mountain climbing, they usually help one another, and if one of them falls, then the others will do whatever they can to save that person. I'm not a mountain climber, but I know that they basically all tie themselves to a rope to one another for safety. Look at all the teams the climb mount Everest, they go as a team, in an extreme environment, and work together as a team for the safety of each other.
In my opinion, I feel that people should be able try and bring out their best in anything they like to do.
 Like I said, as long as they are not hurting anyone else in the process. People should be able to take risks, and I say that it is selfish to not take risks. People takes risks everyday just stepping outside their door, and they are not selfish for doing that. 

The line however can be drawn in any sport, extreme or not, where your goal is to eliminate other players through means of physical harm. I can not think of any sport, extreme or not where that is the case though.

In this country, known as Prestonia, the people lived in a superior manner, which was a result of the abundant resources that was available in the country as well as the breakthroughs in technology found in the scientists of the country. The prosperity of the country was a source of envy for their rivals, but there were no wars or battles that involved Prestonia for it was a pacifist country. It did not involve itself in such ways with other countries, choosing instead to trade strategically primarily for the benefit of itself.
The people in Prestonia were known as the Prestonians and they lived comfortably in their country.
 That is, until many countries in the world had formed an agreement with one another to increase trade with one another, and to foster cooperation. Prestonia naturally declined, as it was a country built on self-sufficiency, and for it trade was a strategic means for it to grow and expand its influence. It would be the only country to decline the agreement, as the other countries of the world primarily thought it would benefit from more trade with one another. restonia was not willing to compromise its principles, fin fact, it had decided to implement a period of isolation to prove to the other countries that it did not need their help to sustain itself. It had a desire to stand alone and prove to the world that it was capable of maintaining its own existence, a desire that was shared among the leaders of Prestonia and its many citizens. On March 1880, Prestonia entered a 10 year period of isolation.
Because of Prestonia's decision to isolate itself, the other countries bwere puzzled by such a decision, and attempted to plea with the leaders of the country to reconsider. However, communications were not made nor established during the isolation, as Prestonia proved it was willing to take its isolation seriously. The world's countries were ultimately disappointed by the decision, but they acccepted Prestonia's wishes, hoping it would be able to handle its isolation as it claimed. The countries thus drew their attention elsewhere, to help each other, and to resolve the other issues found in the world.

10 years later, during the year 1890, the countries of the world had tried to reestablish contact with the country of Prestonia. But they were met with silence. Thinking it had prolonged its isolation, the countries of the world sent a diplomatic envoy to discuss with the leaders of Prestonia the possibility of ending the isolation. The first thing the envoy discovered on their journey to Prestonia, were the ruins of buildings found in the mountains. The same was seen elsewhere among the country of Prestonia, which had no longer any survivors to tell the tale what occurred during the period of isolation. Some experts claim it was a civil war, that broke out during the isolation due to increasing tensions. Others thought it was a natural disaster that was too severe and ravaged the country of Prestonia. In any case, all had agreed that Prestonia was no more, and that the isolation was the final chapter in its history of the world. he story of the country Prestonia is a tale of tragedy and ambition, and perhaps it will be remembered in history as a cautionary alleg

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools should be required to provide free tampons and pads to students in a discreet way that isn't embarrassing for the students themselves.

I am a male so I don't know how young girls feel about this topic and ultimately their opinion is the only one that really matters. I haven't experienced period shaming or period poverty in any way as I don't have children either. 

I don't see any reason why tampons or pads should be treated differently than toilet paper. They are all personal hygiene items that should be provided for students. 

The one difference that I see with regards to these items and items such as toilet paper, paper towels, etc is it's probably very embarrassing for girls in school to be seen with these items or have to ask for them. Why that is, again I'm not really sure as I'm not a woman.

But these girls and their feelings should be taken into account and prioritized. Hence why before I said the schools should provide these items discreetly so no female student has to feel embarrassed. 

I think ultimately schools need to step up. School is supposed to be a safe space for children. Maybe their can be meetings about this topic where only females are allowed to attend. I can totally understand why females talking to males about this subject would be embarrassing nor would males really understand.

If a student's family can't afford pads or tampons, the school should provide them. That's the least they can do with the tax money that they receive from each family, especially if it will add comfort to a student's experience while at the school.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, most definitely, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper variant of the same book. Let's break it down, shall we? At least for me personally, I do not derive as much pleasure from reading books as I used to. Call me lazy, whatever. I like to listen to the audiobook version of almost anything because the narrator more often than not adds personality to the characters my mind does not. Such as voices, an example of that would be the Harry Potter Audiobooks and The Hobbit audiobooks.

Do we even have enough time in the day anymore to do what we like, or even need to do. I personally do not. There is nothing better, as far as being able to read a book, than to be able to do what is needed throughout the day and still be able to listen to a book. I can do chores, run errands, and even go to work and still be able to listen to a book, an not miss out on a new or even classic I really enjoy.

I don't know about you, but I find it far more convenient to buy a book online via Amazon or Audible, than to try to find an almost non existent Barnes and Noble or Books-a-Million in my area. I can just click and buy, so why not just get the audio version of whatever book. 
I think that audiobooks are a great way to get through a book, especially if you are not able to sit down and read it
. I have many of friends who like to read, and all of them think an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper back version of it. We can still have detailed, and in depth conversations about what titles we are reading or listening to.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, yes, paying college athletes would hurt the sport in many ways. first of all, it would be a huge distraction for the players. Meaning that they would focus more on their ability to play the game than they would focus on their college academic courses. Why would you care about how well you did in your economics classes when you are making potentially hundreds of thousands playing a sport. You would lose focus do to the money factor. 
Secondly, it would cause a huge rift between the players and the ir fans potentially. You run the even greater risk of fanatics' going to another campus to do serious harm to other students just so their team can come out ahead. 

Yes I believe it would cause colleges to trade players like they were in some sort of professional sports league. Just to get high profits, instead of focusing on spending money to make their schools better. It would be like an open stock market for college athletes. The potential to start student gambling rings is also even higher than it already is. I feel that it would put the athletes, who do not have the protection of body guards and professional leagues, in greater danger than they need to be. 
I believe that the money would be better spent on the schools and their students.

In my opinion, yes it is, we should watch out for each other first, and then worry about animals.   But I think we should also be able to help animals in need as much as we can.  We should also think about why animals are suffering, is it because of harm caused by us, or is it does nature taking its course.  However, our main concern has to be for each other, our societal standards demand that we watch out for one another.  If we want others to watch over us and be there for us, we have to be willing to do the same.  It can be heart wrenching to see animals suffering, and if we have the ability to intervene we should.  But this should not be in place of taking care of those people who are suffering, whether here or abroad.  We can do many things to protect animals, making choices in how we live our lives and what actions to take, and these can benefit animals in an on going way.  But much of animal suffering is just the natural world, and if we truly got involved we would never have time for anything else in our lives.  That is what I believe, we should help others in need, and not be taken up in the suffering of animals.  I am certain in this opinion that we can't equate the suffering of a human with an animal, and it is, therefore wrong to focus on animals ahead of humans.",17,7,8,0,2,12,2,10,0,2,0.0,0.47058823529411764,0.11764705882352941,0.49722222222222223

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

I have primarily dated using traditional means, which effectively means that I have not used dating apps before. I had preferred to date people I have met in person, or have communicated with through social media. Although I have not used dating apps in the past, I would not be opposed to doing so in the future. I haven't used them given I have had success with meeting people through other means, but I know that it might not be potentially feasible in the future, especially if I want to pursue a more long-term relationship. In any case, I think dating apps and similar technology can be effective in helping people find their significant others. While they may not be a universal answer for people to find dates or to start meaningful relationships, I believe they should still be considered as they provide benefits to people that outweigh its costs.
It is important to remember that technology has always affected dating for about the past century, and it has only gotten increasingly available, efficient, and
 widespread. Many people have access to communications such as their smart phone, allowing them to contact others via text, audio or video calls, and even through social media on the go. In addition, people have the ability to watch a variety of content on their many devices, to find something they have in common and enjoy spending time doing with their date or significant other. These are very much modern comforts that make dating easier for people. Without technology, people would be unable to communicate as easily with others, especially those they want to start or maintain a romantic interaction. In these type of interactions, communication is key, and technology helps maintain communication during the busy lives that many people in the modern world hold. 
With these in mind, technology actually improves the way people interact with each other.
 While some cons exist with the existence and adoption in modern technology such as the potential for people to focus less on their romantic interactions, and more on other content or people, I think people have the means to find a way to moderate their technology use, to avoid the consequences of depending too much on technology. Technology can improve communication and relationships, by allowing people to see and hear each other as well as spend time with each other through shows and movies, which would be much more difficult to access in the pat where such technology did not exist. Dating apps are one way people start and find romantic connections, and while many might not find it as valuable as others will, it along with other technologies are beneficial tools for dating that I believe will continue to exist and be refined in the near future.",24,9,10,0,5,6,5,1,2,3,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.20833333333333334,0.444022770398482

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that. 

Media has evolved when it comes to portraying stereotypes. Remakes are being done where once weak female characters are now tougher. Even the infamous Psycho death scene was changed for the show Bates Motel. The iconic female victim switched to a male victim in the shower. 

I personally don't have a problem with stereotypes. Sometimes I may cringe when I see them but that's part of it. Characters are getting written with more depth these days so it's becoming less of an issue. ",22,4,17,0,1,10,1,9,0,1,0.0,0.7727272727272727,0.045454545454545456,0.6164874551971327

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, a person should be allowed to pursue extreme sports, with certain conditions. Their pursuit needs to be solitary or with others that acknowledge the potential to be harmed or killed by another's action. Their pursuit should disqualify that person from insurances, both health and life. Some people are quite capable of handling extreme sports, others not so. Why should all participants be banned because some would not handle it well? Banning participation violates human rights.

Morally, a person should not participate in extreme danger, whether sports or otherwise, if they are depended on by vulnerable people such as children and the elderly. That would be like saying to someone that they are not worthy of care. 

Why do some people participate in extreme sports? There is more than one answer to this question. Some people are adreneline junkies and look for extreme sports to feel that high. Others need to prove something about being fearless and brave, which is sad.  To what degree does one take risk? This depends on age, ability and perceived danger. Also, some extreme sports have some safety measures built in like being tethered to something greater than the participants actions and in the gear they wear.

The humans decided to use their reawakened energy to fight, and take back what was once theirs, Earth. The aliens had advanced technology, but humans had advanced magic.

In my opinion, there are many stereotypical characters in pop culture. You often will have stereotypical African Americans and homosexuals. In general it does not come down to if a character is stereotypical for me. It really comes down to if the show, book or movie surrounding the character is good. One example is modern family. It has a very stereotypical view of homosexuals but I like many other aspects of the show so it's okay.

 Sometimes stereotypes are needed for specific types of comedies. A show like Reno 911 is a good example.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---
Technology helps people feel less shy when it comes to approaching the person they are interested in. It is easier to send that message of introduction or contact on apps and websites than in person.

Online dating has made it possible for the introverted or less socially skilled to meet others like them, or if not like them, can at least understand and accept them. 

In fact, the use of online dating by the socially unskilled overcomes one of the chief problems with dating apps: namely, the incessant and pervasive lying. Users who describe the problems they have with social performance are not lying to make themselves more attractive, but rather taking a risk in the hope of attracting someone who can be equally honest. There is no social upside in describing the difficulties you have in meeting or talking to people, unless the person you meet has a hard time too.

Wen people describe themselves as athletic, athletic-minded, adventurous or intellectual, this may be a lself-promoting ie . Saying one is frightened, lonely or shy, however is more a beacon then a boast: a beacon others in the same boat may see and be drawn to. In fact, w might say online dating is democratic in tmpowering the lonely and socially awkward to be honest about themselves without fear of negative social fallout
.

People may flame or harass others on a dating app, or course, but built-in safeguards app-mediated meetings much safer than physical ones. Online dating is where the socially fearless mingle with the socially fearful, and the fearful can find solace with others who understand.

This use of dating apps to empower the socially isolated needs further investigation as it may be one of online dating's chief benefits.",20,9,6,0,5,9,6,3,3,3,0.0,0.3,0.25,0.543661971830986

The story of Mana is a story of the human race.
 It all starts with us.

What is Mana? It's power. It's strength. it's discipline. It's hope. Love. Wonder. 

Mana is something that all people used to possess; humans were innately born with it, possessed by its kindness, and automatically instilled with how to use it.
But with the advancement of technology, the human race has become so dependent on it that we've forgotten how to use Mana.


Also, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

(Just Kidding.)

But basically, Mana is one of the most important qualities on this planet, and it's slowly dying, fading into the societal abyss.

At least it was until the aliens attacked.

To figure out how he did it so maybe it could be used for other secret doings for the government, and for two to see if he could send out another pulse that could change all the mugs back to normal, how they used to be. Basically so people would stop freaking out. 
Bob agreed to work with the government and try to fix this problem.
 He didn't mean it anyways. He figured that all he had to do was to to reverse the polarities of the pulse. So that is exactly what he did.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---
In some ways, many if not all sports are selfish to pursue. The pursuit of any sport requires dedication, patience and often sacrifice to achieve one's goals, which includes prestige and reputation. The top athletes are revered by many, but their actions do not necessarily benefit others directly. Rather, many athletes serve as sources of inspiration, to motivate others to achieve their goals and overcoming obstacles, even if it isn't regarding the same sport or activity. W
hen it comes to high risk sports, the cathlete puts time and effort to train and hone their abilities, to meet with exceedingly high demands that are associated with those kind of sports. Like other sports, the end results or reasons for why such people would do high risk sports deemed dangerous are primarily self-serving. It is often for fame and prestige, while some do it to prove themselves that they can. It is often about pushing the limits of what is possible, and leaving behind a legacy. Those people that do break the boundaries of the sports are often revered by many, who hear their achievements and see what can be achieved with effort and time. In that cases, pursuing those sports have indirect benefits to others who hear of such achievements. Many can be inspired by tales of people who climb supposedly unscaleable mountains, or people who despite the risk of some sports, were able to break world records. Pursuing those sports are a conscious action people take, who are often well aware of the stakes and dangers found in the sport.

In terms of what a person finds is too dangerous to pursue, that lies in the person and how they perceive said sport. Some might perceive mountain climbing as being too dangerous and decline to even attempt it, while others will put in all of the effort, spending years getting better at it, to accomplish feats and impressive displays of prowess. What a person deems is dangerous, might be doable to another person. Thus I doubt that there will be a sport that exists in the world that would be considered by all as too dangerous to do, especially since high risk sports have been around for so long, with people always finding a way to up the ante of the sport. The important thing to note is that the athletes and participants of high risk sports need to be aware of the dangers, and that they take the necessary precautions to minimize failure.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is art. Yes I know most people would disagree with me here, but hear me out. Art is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you express yourself, how to be yourself. Art also teaches a student creativity. Creativity is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you think outside the box. 

Art comes in so many forms, that if we completely removed it from our lives, we would really miss it and then realize how important it is. Inventors are inventive in a way because art gives their imaginations strength to come up with ideas for products and services. Art plays a major role in our lives on an everyday basis, and most of us do not even realize it. 

Some of the forms of art are painting, drawing, sculpting, and music just name a few. Without art, there would be no entertaining movies or TV shows. There would be no beautiful architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. There would be no Mona Lisa. There would be no music, or comedy, or even mimes that entertain us on the street for a dollar or two.

The Americans were surprised that they were the only ones who maintained strict isolation.    The Russians were busy taking up all of Europe, and the Chinese had already colonized Africa.  While America was isolated, they were able to focus on becoming independent from other nations.  They weren't dependent on any fuel sources from other nations.  In fact, they had developed a new fuel source called hadronium.  Hadronium was a block of solid fuel that could be used as a power source for anything from cars to spaceships.  The fuel was very easy to transfer and manufacture.

A single drop of hadronium allowed the average car driver to drive for one year.  The outside word seemed to still be utilizing fossil fuels.  That is the primary reason why the Chinese had colonized Africa.  While the Americans were isolated, they had no contact with the Canadians.  It seemed that climate change had thawed out many of the cold areas of Canada.   They had access to more land than they did before.  

When America first isolated, the American made a deal with the Canadians that they would safeguard Alaska until America got out of isolation.

They only asked that Canada would give up half of the natural resources produced in Alaska.  The Canadians agreed.

Free individuals with rights and independence have implied responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to be informed citizens. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world around us. We have a responsibility to be aware of what is happening in our community, state, and country.  Only by knowing what is happening around us can we make an informed decision on issues that impact our families, our futures, and our world.

I also believe we are a community made up of individuals whose every decision impacts everyone else.  In this age of the internet, it's cheap and incredibly easy to stay informed on current events.

In my opinion, we shouldn't be worried about screen use, we should be grateful that we have it. he benefits of screen time are so great that it is hard to imagine how we would have survived the pandemic without them.
 For starters, when the pandemic began, people quickly found ways of working remotely with the use of technology. Screen time became work time and with that, lots of people that normally work in an office were able to earn a living from home.
creen time also helped us tstayconnect edwith friends and family.
 I know I have older family members who are hard of hearing, and the ability to face time them meant they could still see my face, which helped them better understand me. I'm sure there are many others who benefited this way in keeping up with family members. Screen time also helped us stay informed.
 With so much going on during Covid, and our social lives put on hold, the internet or even the local news became our lifelines. I used to keep up with news by talking to people everyday, but with the start of Covid I was suddenly without that and had to depend on screen time of any sort in order to keep up with the many developing events. SOne of the most helpful benefits of screen use the past year or so has been the ability of students to use their screens to continue school. It hasn't been perfect but at least on some level, students have been able to continue interacting with educators and keeping some sort of pace as it pertains to learning. 
I know excessive screen use has its potential downsides, but in today's situation it should not be of concern.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

Many people find that animals that are suffering or will suffering are ultimately powerless to help or save themselves from such negative outcomes. Although human suffering may be more devastating, it gives the impression to many that people are more capable of controlling their own fate, or that some kind of aid will come to them to ease their suffering. We ultimately see humans as other individuals with infinite potential for change and the ability to help others, whereas the animal is deemed to be in a more helpless position. Therefore, it is evident that people would feel more empathetic toward the suffering of animals, than that of people. It is not wrong to do so, but it does become problematic when we do no extend human empathy to everyone, if not any person that is suffering. It is morally wrong when a person is aware that a person is suffering, and they chose to ignore it without telling others, or doing something active to help or resolve said issue. This is especially so if the person has the resources to provide aid, but chooses otherwise due to selfish reasons. We need to find a balance between helping both the welfare of animals and humans, which includes being aware that animals feel emotions and have emotions like we do, and that there are people all around the world that needs the help of those that can make a difference.

As for people who devote themselves primarily to animal welfare causes over humans, I would not say it is wrong to do so. For perhaps they believe it is a more effective use of their time, and that such causes may not be valued by others who pursue causes or issues that affects humans. As long as those people are aware of all of the suffering that is taking place all around the world, and are actively sharing their findings and efforts to help animals and humans, they can be free to devote themselves to a cause they deem is critical to be resolved by their efforts. It is true the help of the many as opposed to individual efforts that both human and animal welfare initiatives can be successful, and they both require accurate information and efforts to achieve a positive outcome. A person should not be viewed as unethical or immoral for devoting themselves for one cause over the other, as others will still help such cause, and they may assist indirectly or through other means.",19,7,5,0,7,9,7,2,3,4,0.0,0.2631578947368421,0.3684210526315789,0.4416826003824092

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology improves romantic interactions if used properly. It allows us a great way to communicate with people across the world, especially if you share common interests. Communication is a cornerstone of good social relationships, and good communication can prevent us from making mistakes in our dating lives. f you share common interests with a person and communicate with them online, you'll already have an idea of how you deal with ehhem
 You'll have an idea of their tone, the things they say, and more. That allows for a lot less mistakes in the relationship from the start, if it goes online. f you talk and get along well, it's likely that you won't run into many problems.
 It's also great for those who are too shy tor nervous o approach the person in question.
 If you're having a hard time meeting the person of their dreams, dating apps are here to help. You can set certain preferences and talk to people with the same interests, meaning they're almost always a match and conversation is much more likely. Instead of approaching someone and asking if they're interested in dating, you can check their profile for a match and then talk to them online. This will allow you to present yourself properly, wait for a good opportunity and then move forward from there.  In a lot of cases, this makes it much easier to snag that special someone with much less work. You can also use technology as a way to get closer with your partner.
 It can be used as a way to stay in touch with your partner, without neglecting your own needs. This is especially helpful in today's busy world.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I think they should be provided as needed. It’s a reality that girls go through “that time of the month.” Hygiene products are a basic need. It’s a fact of life. Some families provide them for adolescents. Some families don't for a variety of reasons. Sometimes families are too poor and can't afford to buy feminine hygiene products. Some families are neglectful and simply don't make it a priority to provide these products. It would be a shame for a student to be in school and not have a pad or tampon when it is needed. So, it's up to schools to be prepared.

Every school should have a plan. Just like they have a plan if a student falls and needs ice for her knee, or a band-aid or if there’s an emergency, there should be a plan if someone needs a feminine hygiene product. Schools should have pads and tampons readily available on hand. They should be comfortable and effective first and foremost. Secondly, they should be easy to access. No one wants to go back to the nurse and say, “I need a pad.” There should be a designated place in every restroom. That way it’s just there for the taking.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes are definitely needed to be compensated for their efforts and for their contributions to the success of their teams. The money that flows through these colleges are vast enough that extra compensation does not harm any of the parties involved: the players, the colleges and the television networks. It's very manipulative and very cruel to deny athletes the well-deserved monetary compensation. There's also no real evidence to support that it would cripple the economics of college sports as claimed by Cody J. McDavis in his article ""Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports"".

Because here's the thing. If you demand someone to do something for you, it's only right to compensate him/her for the act he/she committed. Not granting them any compensation is a form of slavery and exploitation. These college athletes have worked their bodies to the absolute limit, tearing their tendons and sustaining all sorts of damages, but at the end of the day, they do all that for just a piece of paper that says they are college graduates. 

We need to properly compensate college athletes so that this will help decrease the number of kids who are simply just grinding and not get any monetary pay-off. The funds going in these college sports are nowhere near the little size they were years ago, owing to the shortsightedness of the last two generations. The world has changed, and how these schools are taking money in is very much outdated. We should not enrich those CEO's or those salaries of Deans or who ever owns the colleges, what we need to do instead is to put a stop to the exploitation of college athletes by compensating them for the work they have been doing all their lives.

Sure, an athlete with great foundation and great performance during their plays on tournaments would definitely earn them proper and high-paying careers in the future. But what about those who don't? Are we just going to end up tossing them aside, even if they were the ones who brought the college to championships? The money that came from donations, contracts with vendors, sponsorships and licensing of merchandise are being used to pack the pockets of those CEO's who own the colleges, earning them more money and will never be seen by those college athletes.

So yeah, what I'm saying is that there should definitely be a change on how we compensate our athletes; it's time we stop exploiting them and put a stop to exploitation and start doing what is right and proper: pay the college athletes. We need to hold those CEOs who own those college athletes accountable for their ill actions and to stop exploiting college athletes in their quest for profit.",27,9,3,1,14,17,17,0,0,17,0.037037037037037035,0.1111111111111111,0.5555555555555556,0.48807631160572335

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, finances and problem-solving skills are the most important things that can be taught to a person. I believe that it is important to be able to manage your money and make the most of what you have. Money is one of the most important factors in life. If you don't have it, you likely won't be happy.  The happiness levels of the impoverished are incredibly low.  If more people learned how to manage finances from a young age, there would be less poverty as people wouldn't go wasting their money on things they don't need or living above their means.

The second thing that is extremely important is the ability to solve problems. Life is full of problems. If you can't solve them, you will have a hard time getting through life. Many people encounter problems in life and freeze, not knowing what to do.  Those who know how to problem solve generally have a better chance of success. They give up less, as they are always looking for solutions. 

Unfortunately, I was not taught anything about finances in any of my school classes.  It would have been great for me, as I have not always been good with my finances. I have made a lot of mistakes and I have learned from them. Thankfully, I was taught to problem solve. I solved my financial problems with these skills and now I live a stable and secure lifestyle. I am very happy with my life. I was able to find a job before I finished college, and then after I found out I hated that job, I was able to switch my line of work completely and start my own business. There were many challenges with starting a business, but I did it, and I was successful. I don't use my computer science degree, but I am happier for it. I am glad I learned how to problem-solve.

In my opinion, there should be some research done to determine the cost of providing free pads and tampons to students. If the cost is minimal, then schools should provide them. If the expense is too high, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons. If there are serious budget issues, then schools should provide students with the information they need to access free pads and tampons, and also provide students with the information they need to access them on their own.  Some schools are so poor that they can’t even afford toilet paper. It’s not like they can just go to the store and buy pads and tampons.

In my opinion, there are a few things students should learn in school that are primary. The first is the ability to communicate. All things involving literary knowledge contribute to communication. Reading and writing are greatly involved in communication. It is through reading and writing that students learn language fluently enough to understand and be understood by others. Surely this is one of the most important things.
The second is the ability to think critically.
 Even though this sounds basic, this skill teaches a person how to learn. In school students are often asked questions that teach them how to look up answers and basically how to infer knowledge about how to ask and answer questions about our world. 
The third is the ability to work with others.
 Often in school, some classes will periodically place students in groups or pairs in order to work together. This helps them learn how to get along with other people in the real world. In many, if not most jobs, the skills used when working together become important to put to use. This can include anything from listening, to collaborating ideas, and even to dealing with the frustrations that can arise when working with others. Putting these skills into practice at an early age is very important for social development.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, I don't believe it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. We should focus on both with an emphasis on humans. If nature is doing well then humanity is able to continue on as it develops as a species but if nature is not doing well then it will have an impact on human well being. In that respect, nature and humanity are interdependent and must be protected. Unfortunately, humans are selfish creatures and many will ignore the well being of others if it gives them an advantage so it is important that we have safe guards in place to help protect the animals and their habitats so humanity has meat and crops to eat. We have to have a more of a symbiotic relationship with our animal cousins so we respect them more and not ignore the harsh realities of things like factory farming. They torture animals and they can also breed plenty of disease as well that does cross over to humans. In this respect, it is vital that we protect our food production system and fight inhumane treatment of animals as well as protecting ecosystems in general. We must balance things out so we can take care of both sides not just one. We must not pick and choose which side we will focus on. They are two sides of the same coin. So I suggest we focus on both in one all encompassing plan and work from there, because we share this world equally.",19,7,7,1,4,9,5,4,2,3,0.05263157894736842,0.3684210526315789,0.2631578947368421,0.511049723756906

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. The aliens control the whole planet, and have for many years. But now that some people are discovering they have powers, they are learning in secret how to use them so that they can overthrow the aliens. They are also learning to work together, and to hide who they are from the aliens.

The leader of the humans with recently reawakened Mana powers is Lia. As the oldest, and the first to discover her powers, she decided to help others like her. When she first discovered that she was suddenly stronger than everyone around her, even the horrible aliens, she nearly gave herself away many times. To keep others like her from giving themselves away like she almost did, she looks out for other people exhibiting odd behavior, who might also be Mana weilders. Over the years, she has created a network of people who can spot teenagers and adults with newly awakened powers, and her network shuttles those people to her to be trained in secret.
This has made Lia one of the most trusted people in the resistance.
 It has taken years for the resistance to finally gain the strength they need to defeat the aliens, but they are working quietly, gathering forces and weapons to make one sweeping stand against the three main alien strongholds dotted around the world. Lia has trained her soldiers well, and they feel ready to finally wipe out the aliens once and for all.
But before they strike, Lia receives a request for help from an unexpected source.
 There is a small group of secretive power-wielders, who have always been wary of Lia and her resistance group. They never believed that the aliens could be defeated, so they holed up on their own, at an outpost far north of Lia. She gambles on making the trek to them to beg for their help, because she knows her resistance fighters may not win without the help of these other, extremely powerful Mana wielders. 
The journey is long and hard, but Lia finally arrives.
 When she does, she is shocked to discover that they are not only ready and willing to help, they themselves have been trianing hard to take on the aliens on their own. SHe convinces them to join forces with her. They reach the resistance army, and the stage is set for a final confrontation between Mana wielders of all levels once again taking on the alien invaders. The battle is long and firece, with many human caualties in all three battle locations. But with the help of the new Mana wielders, the humans finally succeed and wipe out the aliens.

It was a dark and cloudy day that seemed to feel like impending doom. Again we hear news of Matt Damon going missing again due to the pesky aliens that seem unrelenting in their pursuit of his brain. Once again we scramble to find out what happened to him and where he is. Most people know Matt and he truly is an amazing and nice person overall. He has done many great things for humanity such as his work helping to feed the hungry. This of course pushes us to help him whenever something bad happens because we treat him like our own. The usual extraction team sets off into space to infiltrate the alien ship and take him back. hen the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through.
 There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. 

Finally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the ""biggest and baddest"" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.

The team flies home and celebrates the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt into a maximum-security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport. Matt is sad about the news but realizes there is no other way until all the aliens are killed. The team goes to see him off and wishes him luck, Matt thanks them for the help and says he will never forget them.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology can affect dating in multiple ways. It can either affect dating in a positive way or in a negative way depending on your personality. 
In my case, I've found that technology has affected dating in a positive way.
 I have found that being able to communicate with your significant other over the internet or with apps, makes it easier to handle conflicts and things that may upset your partner because you are not face-to-face with them so that eases a lot of the stress and anxiety of the conflicts. 

ecause of technology, I've also found that it's easier to keep your significant other up to date with what you are doing.
 For instance, I've found that I am able to send my girlfriend little funny text messages about my day which she appreciates, and you can send them whenever you want provided your not working or are on a work break. 

On the other hand, technology could affect more outgoing people in a negative way maybe if they are a more outgoing person and would rather be talking face to face with someone rather than talking with someone over text. They might feel more lonely talking over text than more introverted people would.

So to conclude, in my opinion, technology affects dating in a positive way for more introverted people. And it would probably affect more outgoing people in a negative way since they would prefer to be face to face rather than text.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

I don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the illustrations, diagrams, and author's notes. I can skip to the back for a quick timeline or genealogy. 
I think it's also because I'm a very fast reader.
 I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. 
I also like the fact that I can read a book in any order.
 I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning if I have questions. Reading a real book appeals to my independence and ADHD. 

Hardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about an apathetic, sleepy, or nasal narrator. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, screen crack, or need charging. 

 think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening.
 You can walk, drive, or do housework while you're listening. You can't do that with a book.

I can recognize why people would listen to audiobooks, and why they're not for me. I prefer a book in my hand, and the freedom to control the pace!",27,7,4,4,12,31,22,9,5,17,0.14814814814814814,0.14814814814814814,0.5925925925925926,0.4419889502762431

Billions of people believe in reincarnation, so let's assume that their right. That means that animals are likely to be either beings that will come back as humans, or else humans whom the karmic wheel has demoted.
So, if you are a meat eater, you are likely to be eating your own relatives.
 Not only that. but that meal may make the relative bear you quite a grudge. One can only wonder how many of a person's enemies were animals that the person hurt or mistreated in either the current or a previous life.

So it's really in your own best interest to treat animals well, because karma, as they say, is a bitch. 

Is there any proof of this, you may ask? Certainly! If you look into the face of any dog, you can see its resemblance to a person. My mother, in fact, had a German Shepherd named Francis who was a spitting image of my late Uncle Joe. Not only that, but Francis would lie in from the TV watching March Madness games in exactly the same spot my Uncle favored when he was alive.

Have you ever met a person to whom you had an instant connection. It may be that this is someone who you were nice to when they were an animal in a previous life. Or have you ever met someone and experienced instant antipathy? Maybe when that person was an earthworm in a previous life and you split them open with a fishhook.
So, if you want to be aget ahead in this universe treat animals well.
 They may be your relatives, or even your boss in a future life.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, and my experience, dating apps are a mixed bag. On the one hand, they provide a way to meet people who you might not otherwise meet, but on the other, they might end up causing you to meet people who you really don't want to meet and would otherwise avoid. On the good side when it comes to dating apps, they can be a relatively safe way of sizing up your dating options. On the bad side, though, they can expose you to risk, by exposing you to people who might be dangerous or otherwise not good for you, and enabling those people to disguise their true nature until it's too late, and you 've already met them in person.

Netflix also has its good and bad sides. One of the benefits of Netflix is that it allows you to watch a lot of movies and TV shows that you might not otherwise have seen, and that might facilitate getting to know more about your partner. However, Netflix can also be a bad thing, because it can be a distraction from spending time with your partner, and it can also be a bad thing if you end up getting recommendations that one or the other of you don't like, and would otherwise avoid.

Texting, similarly, has both good and bad sides. A benefit of texting is that it can be a relatively convenient way of communicating with a current or potential partner because it's not as immediate as talking on the phone or in person. But a pitfall of this, is that it can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and can also be a way of avoiding talking to your partner in person. So, texting can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how it's used, and the specific circumstances of the relationship.

Personally, I haven't found dating apps, Netflix, or texting to be of much use in dating, but many of my friends and acquaintances have had very different experiences, and some have even met long term partners, or even spouses, through these means. I guess like anything else, these are all tools. They can do certain things, but it is ultimately up to the user to decide how they will be used, and whether they will be used for good or ill.",23,9,2,1,11,35,23,12,0,23,0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,0.5217391304347826,0.4400871459694989

---

In my opinion, dating apps are okay to scan for potential compatability. It is nice to choose a few people to meet. It is acceptable to use dating apps because it is not easy to meet someone in real life. Dating apps expand the options one can choose from. 

I have not used dating apps, If I were younger and single, I am pretty sure I would try them. My biggest concern is for safety.  People online do not always present themselves accurately. It would be a great way for a criminal to rob or rape someone. I like the idea of being able to check out the person a little bit.  I would probably ask to call them at work and I would definitely google them.

Technology has both helped and hurt dating. It is easy to isolate in social and entertainment online venues. It is also easy to embellish things about yourself, which is not honest. Relationships have less face to face communication and socialization. I think body language is essential to undestanding someone. People in a relationship need to hold each other accountable for real life time together away from technology. I think the conscious effort to do this prevents people from falling down the proverbial rabbit hole, only to find that hours passed that they could be spending with their loved one.
I think technology has made dating easier for people who are shy or have social anxiety.
 The person can communicate with someone a little bit before an actual date. This is a good way to break the ice that can cause anxiety.  

In conclusion, dating apps are acceptable with common sense caveats. They are a tool.",30,9,20,0,1,3,1,2,0,1,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.03333333333333333,0.5549132947976878

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, i dont find it wrong to focus on Animal Welfare. I say this because i dont feel we are ignoring human suffering. I think that there is just so much human suffering that we need to pick and choose where to divert our attention to. Likewise with animals, there are many animals that suffer on our planet. I think there needs to be some sort of moderation on both since it is unrealistic to think we can combat all suffering in both categories.  In addition to that, i think the media has sort of desensitized human suffering since it is so common. For this reason, we as humans have more of a emotional reaction when we see animals being taken advantage of over humans. We understand that both are wrong, however we see it so often for humans that we sort of just repress it in a way. I think that emotional reaction is still there if we see a kid being harmed, however a grown adult we just sort of brush aside. As far as the 40 percent saving their dog over a tourist, i think i would have to agree. Our dog is like family, so if there was a life to save i would probably go with my dog. I would not really be super sad if something happened to the tourist, simply because i do not know them personally. If something happened to my dog i would be extremely upset and saddened. Its an easy choice for me, but i would just relate it to family over non family.  So being more empathetic to suffering animals is really just something that society has done to us in a way i guess. It would be interesting to find out how humans would react to stimuli involing a human death and animal death, if they had grown up in an era with no media aside from writing. Maybe the reaction would be higher for humans because they can relate to a human death more. I dont find it wrong either way to focus on welfare of animals or humans, because if that is what your focused on that you are an empathetic individual. Everyone's perspective is different and what may cause one person to take the death of a human strongly, may not do the same to someone else. This is the beauty in everyone being different, and having had different experiences. Just from my own perspective, i think i would probably have the stronger reaction seeing a dog being beat by a bat over an adult. But if it was a child instead i think the child would take the cake over an animal, but thats just me. Anyway, in conclusion, i dont think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare at all, i think everyone is different and people are going to focus on what makes them most enthusiastic.",29,7,22,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0.0,0.7586206896551724,0.0,0.3939393939393939

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school is discipline and being responsible for my own actions. School teaches us many important subjects such as math, English, history, etc but discipline is the one that sticks with me the most.

I remember all of the times that I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends but instead stayed disciplined so I would get good grades. I remember the times when my grades would slip and I'd have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for that. 

School also taught me how to socialize with others and how to respect other people who have differing opinions than me. That type of tolerance is especially important as we get older. 

I think that type of discipline greatly affected my adult life as well. At my job I am a bit of a perfectionist and won't stop until I have things done right. I just am a very prideful person and when you combine pride and discipline with hard work, you'll normally see success. 

I also understand that all students are different. So I really don't think there's one exact thing that all students need to learn or focus on. So my advice to students now would be to take school seriously and see if any subject really grabs you. Some students will be passionate about history, some English, some math, some science. That type of passion can lead you the right way and set the foundation of what your adult life is going to be.

When I was in High School, I knew for a fact that I wanted a job that was going to involve technology and computers. Fast forward 10-15 years and that's exactly what I'm doing. I work as a technical support Manager at a web hosting company where I solve technical issues for customers. 

I combined my passion, discipline and pride to move right up the ladder and get a dream job. The great thing is that there is nothing stopping current students from doing the same. ",24,6,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.5

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, more and more I feel like the stereotypical white male protagonist is making me cringe when it comes to TV shows and movies. I get that these characters are supposed to be the ""everyman"" or the ""everywoman"" but it's getting to the point where I'm tired of seeing them. Why is it always something that a white male, having to have a certain amount of money, power, or influence to be considered a protagonist? Just look at the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. In the later movies we did get to see some diversity, but when it started we have a billionaire (Iron Man, a white male), we have a literal god, (Thor, a white male), a doctor (Hulk, a white male), and a soldier (Captain America, a white male). It is as if we needed to have those characters first so that we could have a black male (Black Panther) and a female (Scarlett Witch) be protagonists.

I am not saying that I hated these movies. I'm just saying that I'm tired of seeing the same type of character over and over again. It's the same thing that when later American Idol winners were all white males with guitars. It's very rare that you see a female or a person of color win. It's definitely nothing specific that these actors have done or a specific action that they have made on their films, but the cringeworthy thought of the producers of these films having to do a meeting and say ""We need to have a white male lead."" It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist.

So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance. The light towards the end of the tunnel is nearing, as we are actually seeing more and more diversity today, and I hope that this continues.

 The obvious bad effect is that the screen time deprives us of the actual social contact with our family members, friends and coworkers. We can't feel the closeness with our loved ones, nor can we hug them to show our affection. We can't share a meal with them, or play with our kids. The second reason is that screen time distracts us from the real world. We are so busy with our screens that we don't notice what is going on around us. We don't notice the people who are sick and need help. We don't notice the people who are in need of a hug, or who are lonely and need a friend. We also lack the time to get enough physical exercise.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports should be stopped because of the damage can do to the athletes.  While I dont think it is selfish for them to play the sports, I just feel they are either misinformed or do not know the long term effects it could have on them. Some athletes end up with long term health issues and could even die from them because of the effects it has on their bodies. I feel that if they took more precautions and were fully informed, then perhaps they would make wiser choices. Ongoing studies need to be done both by the leagues and by unrelated third parties. We need to figure out some kind of cost benefit ratio that perhaps we could apply to all sports. This way we can weigh the risk of getting injured to the benefit of participating in a sport or taking part in an activity. If too many people are getting CTE from playing football changes need to be made or the sport should not be played by minors (at least). This is an area that needs much more studying. We need to know the effects on of these sports on our youth. What does a repeated head injuries as a teenager do to them as an adult and so on. I'm assuming there is more we dont know at the moment then we do so research is key along with active monitoring of the athleats done by the leagues and other parties. This has to be an all out effort to have the most effect and to save the most lives. The bigger this research gets the better for all of us. The safer the players are, the longer we can enjoy their game play. ",19,5,10,0,4,8,4,4,0,4,0.0,0.5263157894736842,0.21052631578947367,0.5355191256830601

They're afraid of the way that people are becoming more educated and more connected. They're afraid of the way that people are becoming more individualistic.

She was sitting at a table in the corner of a restaurant, and she was looking around the room, hoping to catch the eye of someone who would be willing to take her home for the night.  Priscilla wanted someone to ask her, ""Why is someone as beautiful as you eating alone?'

She had been sitting there for a while, and she was beginning to get bored. She was about to give up, when she saw a man walk into the restaurant. He was tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.

He had been in love with her for a long time, and he had been trying to win her heart for years. He had been in love with her for so long, he had forgotten what he looked like.  He had tried so many forms, trying in vain to win her over. He had been a soldier, a doctor, a lawyer, a fireman, and even a priest.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.
 It had the hallmarks of a good house: it was well-maintained, it was centrally located, and it came with a roommate. They enjoyed it so much, in fact, that they invited their sister Molly to live with them.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons are a necessity in just the same way as toilet paper, soap, and so on. In fact, not providing them is arguably a case of sex discrimination, since all other essentials are supplied. In addition, for school students, puberty is a time when they are still adjusting to needing these supplies, and they may not be prepared. The supplies need to be available conveniently. 
In addition, it is not just a matter of convenience.
 This is a health issue, because the ability to have clean sanitary supplies can help to prevent infections. Since schools are invested in helping students have basic good health in other ways, such as providing a nurse's office, it makes sense to provide a cleanliness necessity just as they supply toilet paper. 

The main way that pads and tampons are different is that only one group needs them. But this does not argue against providing the supplies. Since it is a biological basic necessity, it is not a matter of choice. The same is true for toilet paper, soap, and other products. This really means that not providing these supplies is ignoring a group's basic needs while needs that apply to all students are supplied. It also suggests that those making these types of decisions were not thinking about it and not consulting with those who use the bathrooms. 

To suggest that money is an issue here is to miss the point, because if the school can afford to supply other basic necessities such as indigestion medicine, toilet paper, soap, hand dryers, and tylenol, then pads and tampons fall into the same category and should be paid for from the same budget. School students also have to rely on adults for at least most of their money, since they cannot be employed if they are under the employment age, and if they are old enough to work they cannot work more than 20 hours per week. Many students' families cannot afford everything they need and rely on the school to meet them partway by providing basic needs during the school day. In conclusion, yes, school should supply sanitary products for students. ",23,7,14,0,2,10,3,7,0,3,0.0,0.6086956521739131,0.08695652173913043,0.4707259953161593

You explain to him that that is impossible as JFK has been dead for over 25 years.

The person on the other line explains that the death was staged. It wasn't even staged that well which is why there is the 2 shooter theory that we have seen on the internet previously.

You ask JFK some facts about his family and the country during his time of Presidency. He answers every question accurately. He explains that his families life was in danger.

JFK had gotten involved with the mob and they were threatening to expose him.  This would have led to him being in jail or worse. Therefore he staged his own death to avoid consequences from the mob. This allowed him to enter a highly discreet version of witness protection that is only viable for people with extremely high amounts of power and positioning. 

You get to the bottom of it and ask JFK what exactly he needs from you. You ask why he needs you to fly to him.

JFK explains that the purpose of you coming to visit him is to get off the grid as well. JFK explains that he knows the stress that comes with being President of the United States. He knows what it's like to always be in the limelight.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, based on ten years of using dating apps and similar technological gimmicks, I believe technology is improving dating. Let's start with dating apps. Before the advent of stuff like Tinder and Grindr, you had to go out to bars and clubs or to parties if you wanted to find someone with whom you were interested in dating. The odds that you would meet someone you really liked were pretty slim, but still, you had to do it if you didn't want to be alone. It also took a lot of time and effort, and frequently that time and effort was wasted. Since the advent of apps, this is no longer the case. You can do the same thing, with the added advantage that you can do it from the comfort of your own home, and you can do it whenever and wherever you want to. I'm not sure that the odds of success are greater, but since it takes less effort, and since the result is substantially the same, you can find someone you like a lot more easily... and then talk to him or her without wasting energy and cutting into your schedule in the same way.

I could say similar things about Netflix. Before Netflix and the like existed, you and your partner had to rent movies from the video store or go to the theater. The selection was limited and it was often difficult to find something that both of you would enjoy. It became a repetitive, frustrating ritual, going to the video store, looking at the shelves, putting stuff on hold, waiting for it to come in, then watching the movie and often feeling unsatisfied afterward. Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff.

Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into. On the whole, it's made staying in touch with partners much easier and more enjoyable.

And that's kind of my take on all the 21st century innovations in dating. They haven't fundamentally changed the things that you need to do to establish and maintain a relationship, but they have made doing all of those things easier and more convenient. What could be wrong with that?",29,9,3,0,17,22,19,3,0,19,0.0,0.10344827586206896,0.5862068965517241,0.4785714285714286

In my opinion, I think schools should provide pads or tampons to students. Not every student is going to have a pad or tampon with them when their period strikes and I do not think that ""period poverty"" is even a thing, I think that it is just a way for people to make fun of girls and women who are on their period. It is no different than having toilet paper or paper towels available to students. No one makes fun of people for using the paper towel dispenser after they have washed their hands. You don't hear about ""towel poverty"". It is not an issue. I am not a female and I do not have first-hand experience with this, but I never heard any of the girls in my school get teased for anything like ""period poverty"". I think that schools would be actually helping the female students out by making pads available to them. I don't think they should be shamed for not having a sanitary napkin on them at all times or have that be a reason to not make tampons or pads available to students. Maybe having some sort of pamphlet or lesson on how to not make your classmates feel bad about their bodily functions may help alleviate any issues with how students are treated regarding their periods.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair because uranium can't be blown down. The pig had studied on the internet and done a ton of research after seeing all the other pigs in the community have their houses blown down by the wolf. 

That would caused the entire home to collapse. 

It was difficult to obtain uranium but luckily for the pig, he was able to find some on Amazon. He also had a ton of experience building homes. The wolf went back to his house and tried to do some research of his own. He had to figure out what could destroy uranium. 

The internet is an amazing place because the wolf was able to figure out that water destroys uranium. The wolf just had to figure out how to get enough water to the pigs home. He did some thinking and went back online. He did research and figured the best way to do this is to rent a water truck. A water truck is a big truck that has a hose similar to a firetruck. The wolf planned to drive the water truck to the pigs home and spray the home with water. 

The wolf drove to the pigs home and got out of the water truck. He turned the hose and sprayed the home and to his dismay, the house didn't collapse like the internet said it would.  The pig came out of his house and was laughing at the wolf. He explained to him that the house wasn't actually made of depleted uranium. He would never tell the wolf the material of the home because he knew the wolf would go straight to the internet to find out how to ruin his house.

The pig tells the wolf to leave him and his house alone.

In my opinion, its science. I think that science is by far the most important thing that students should learn in school because it teaches us about the natural world and how it works. The scientific method in particular is very valuable. It teaches us how to think critically and how to solve problems. It also teaches us how to be skeptical and how to question things. It teaches us how to think for ourselves and how to be independent, rational observers. The scientific method particularly is an invaluable tool that helps us make small daily desc ions to big life changing decisions. It helps us to figure out what is most likely fake news and what is not. Overall, it helps us to figure out what is most likely true and what is not. Without basic scientific knowledge it is very hard to make sense of the world.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The serum causes delayed neurodegenerative brain damage, and the majority of humanity, while not aging, are getting less intelligent, and less capable of maintaining civilization. They're also becoming increasingly violent and erratic. By the time this has occurred, most of the ""Lost Generations"" have died, and you are one of the younger members. It's up to you, and your elderly fellow survivors, to solve the problem before humanity is completely wiped out.

A few of your group are scientists. They've managed to reverse-engineer the serum.

The rest of you are responsible for keeping them safe until the drug has been perfected. The battle is uneven, you're outnumbered, and also inferior in terms of strength and stamina.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there are no stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe, and I would never avoid watching or reading something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. 
I think that stereotypes are a part of life, and they are not always negative.
 For example, I am a female, and I think that it is a stereotype that women are more emotional than men. But I don't think that it is a bad stereotype, because it is true. I don't see how anyone could be offended by a stereotype that is true. It's just an objective fact.

I generally think that people who cringe at stereotypical characters are just being oversensitive. I think that people should be able to laugh at themselves. And if a character is a stereotype, then it is just a character. It is not a real person; it is just an author or writer's interpretation of a specific person with specific and unique thoughts. If you don't like the way that the character is portrayed, then just don't read or watch the book, film or show. It's really that easy. You don't even need to explain why you don't like it. You don't need to petition the author or the filmmaker or the movie production company. You can just walk away. 

This is why I don't understand why people get so upset about stereotypes. They always say that they are offended by them, but I don't see how they could be offended by something that is not real. And if they are offended by something that's totally fabricated, then they are just being ridiculous. I mean, why would you be offended by something that's not real?

I think all media forms are to be appreciated for their entertainment value. Some of the most comedic movies and television shows are the ones that use stereotypes. Some examples I can think of include the movie ""The Hangover"" and the television show ""The Big Bang Theory."" I mean, in the Big Bang Theory, the main characters are all stereotypical nerds. The one exception is the main character's girlfriend, who is a stereotypical hot blonde. And in The Hangover, the main characters are all stereotypical frat boys. The Hangover characters are so stereotypical that they are almost caricatures. But how could you think that these movies and shows are offensive? They're just funny, and honestly I find them pure comedic gold.

It really annoys me that society has become so oversensitive. When did we as a country become so politically correct? I mean, I am a liberal, but I don't think that we should be so sensitive about everything. I am all for being sensitive to people who are being oppressed, but I don't think that we should be so on our toes about everything and there is certainly no need to be policing the media to the extent that we currently do. 

In conclusion, I think that authors and writers and film producers should be able to write whatever they want. If any member of the audience is offended by something that they see, then they should just walk away. But those members of the audience who are offended should not try to censor the media or try to police what consenting members of the audience want to see.

In my opinion,  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. I believe that this is a personal decision that should be left up to the individual. If a student is experiencing period poverty, they should be able to purchase pads and tampons from the school store at a lower price but for a limited quota. Pads and tampons are only used by female students, so if they are provided for free, it is unfair to the male students. In my opinion, free stuff from school should be provided equally to all the students, but not just a portion of it. But if a student has financial difficulty, they may ask the school for financial help in order to get enough supply of pads and tampons. Supplying the sanitary stuff free to just financially constrained students sounds more acceptable than providing them to all the female students, as they are not similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools. In addition, students in poverty can apply for government aids to satisfy their daily needs including getting those sanitary stuff.

My presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by ""JFK"". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This ""JFK"" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. I stood in the terminal for a few minutes, when a man dressed in a black suit and tie approached me. ""Mr. Obama, please come this way."" I hesitantly followed the man for I did not know this stranger in the black suit. He lead me to a private plane, with the license plate reading ""The Flying White House"". The man in the black suit opened the door for me, and I entered the plane. The inside of the plane was similar to Air Force One, but more regal. The man in the black suit closed the door and told me to have a seat, ""Mr. Kennedy will be here shortly"". Somehow I had a feeling that this was some joke meant to ease me into my retirement.  I sat down in a leather seat, and waited for JFK to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, a man in a grey suit boards the plane, I could not see his face. He makes his way toward me and I realize that the man is in fact JFK. I am gobsmacked, this is not a joke. I stood up to shake his hand and to show my respect for a previous president. He sat down across from me and asked, ""do you realize why I have called on you?"". I told him I had no idea what any of this was about, but it must be important to national security. JFK told me that a threat of nuclear war is imminent and I must act accordingly. I told him that I no longer had the power because I was no longer president. I was the wrong person to ask to partake in this job. But JFK argued otherwise, he said that I was the only person who could handle this kind of job. I asked him what he wanted me to do. JFK dropped a folder on the table in front of me, and told me that he wanted me to read it. The file within revealed that the current president was a robot created by the Russians, to start a nuclear war. JFK showed me a device that looked like a pencil, built to disable the robot and stop the threat. The pencil device was meant to be inserted into the center of the robot's CPU and it would cause him to crash and burn. JFK wanted me to go The White House for a ""visit"", so that I could meet the robot president and disable him. I accepted the mission and shook JFK's hand. I left the plane, which took off quickly into the sky. I called Michelle and left a message, telling her I would be paying a visit to The White House for old times sake. I made my way out of the airport, and to the nearest cab. I arrived at The White House and made my way to the interior. Everyone greeted me as if I had neve left. I soon spotted the robot president and introduced myself again. I asked to talk with him in private away from prying eyes. He agreed and we made our way to his office. I pulled out the pencil device and asked him to sit in a chair. I made my move and grabbed him by the neck, shoving the pencil into his head where the CPU was. I activated the device, shutting down the robot in his chair. I had to get out quickly without being noticed. I went out the back door behind the resolute desk and looked for a cab. My phone rang, JFK called me to congratulate me on a mission well done.  He said I had served my country well once more. He had sent a special car to pick me up and take me home. I got into the car and walked in calmly, seeing Michelle and the girls back from the beach. She asked how my day went and I said ""it could not have gone any better"", with a smirk.

Moreover, why would she order a bee to protect you? You've spent your entire life actively avoiding bees. Your mother has forbidden you to even go near them.

Well, how about that! You've never even heard of a guard bee before, and now here you are talking to one!

You ask Alfred why your mother thought you needed his help. He says that your mother worries about you a lot. She ordered Alfred to protect you and make sure you don't do anything stupid. You laugh and ask if he's really going to be able to protect you. ""Try me,"" he says, and flies off your shoulder. You say that you want to go for a bike ride. Alfred says he'll follow you. You ask if he thinks you should pack a picnic lunch too. Alfred says ""Of course!""

Later you go on your picnic, with your bike basket loaded up with all your treats and sandwiches. You're about to take off without your helmet but Alfred stops you again. He tells you that there's something important about helmets. You have to wear one. You groan. You can practically hear your mother's voice through Alfred's. You put on your helmet and kick off with Alfred on your shoulder. Later, you get to the picnic park and start munching your treats. You offer Alfred a sandwich, but he says that bees only eat pollen from flowers, not from sandwiches. You ask why Alfred refused to let you put peanut butter in the brownie batter. Alfred says that he can sense you have a severe allergy to peanut butter. He doesn't want you to end up in the hospital because of it. You're surprised since you've never had a peanut allergy before. ""It's new,"" Alfred tells you. You start to ask Alfred how he knows all this about you, but you're interrupted by a bee. Alfred tells the bee to go away. He's annoyed that this bee is encroaching on his territory. The bee flies off and Alfred explains to you that as a guard bee, he has special sensors and is attuned to every risk that might come to you. You are very impressed and from that moment on, you let Alfred guard and protect you, and you end up living a safe life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should embrace our screens. All of human history has seen paradigm supplant paradigm: rock paintings, then oral histories, then the printing press, then radio, then TV, then the computer, then AR and AI and social media. Are any of these ""better"" than the others? Or is each the product of a unique zeitgeist that will never come again?
The answer is that each is a product of its time and place, and each has its own unique value.


Looking forward, I am sure than in 100 years, in 200 years, all manner of human interaction will take place of which we currently only dream. Brains in vats (how's that for isolation)? Personality uploads at the moment of death? Brain transplants? No doubt if any of these come to pass, they will be bemoaned as the end of ""true"" humanity, of ""true"" human interaction.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, McDavis is right on point. College athletes are still students, and should be treated as such; besides, providing money to student-athletes would only lead to further corruption. No other students are actually paid for what they do in college, so why should these athletes be any different? They already receive money to live on, and scholarships, what more could they want? If they were paid to play sports, they'd not only be getting a free education, and the opportunity to do what they love, and the chance to make a lot of money someday as a professional, they'd be getting paid for the opportunity to do that, which is several bridges too far. Also, I can't help that that would tend to breed resentment among the student-body; can you imagine being a student at a Division III school, having to work part-time jobs to pay for your classes, and seeing student athletes not only get free tuition, and breezing by in classes, but also getting paid for all that? Given the political climates of today's campuses, it could easily lead to student revolts.

The real question here isn't whether student athletes should be paid. The real question is  whether colleges should be in the business of running sports programs, serving as a training ground for pro sports, and relying upon the financial success of the students and the alumni to swell the coffers of the supposed 'educational institution.' A follow up question to that, is should colleges that do that still be granted tax-exempt status or non-profit status, especially since such a large percentage of the earnings of those schools goes towards running the athletic programs?

Again, my answer to all these questions is a resounding, ""NO."" However, if colleges are going to continue to operate in this way, they should at least maintain the pretense that they are in fact there to educate the students, not to provide a free source of labor and entertainment for them,  in order for them to still be considered schools at all. It's marginal now; if they were to start paying students for playing sports, they're no longer schools. They're just sports franchises, like any other, and they'd need to be licensed and regulated as such.",23,9,2,1,11,17,15,2,0,15,0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,0.5217391304347826,0.5

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to audiobooks has its place in the modern world. Although reading has its advantages, listening to an audiobook is great for long commutes, when you have time to exercise, and when you're doing something else but can still be listening to something. Of course there is an advantage to actually reading a book that can't be duplicated with the audio book experience. When a person reads they must put their own efforts into the task and this leads to greater immersion into the story. This is what makes someone love a book or wonder at it after the fact. In a sense when you read a book it becomes a collaborative effort between you and the author. This experience is almost magical, especially for younger people. However, I think we must come to accept that audiobooks are here to stay. In fact many people may grow up listening to audiobooks before they ever read a book. As such they promote young people's interest in literature and that can't be a bad thing. It's likely that  the time that people spend with audiobooks would not be spent reading actual books. So in a way audiobooks can give a boost to reading by introducing people to the experience. As people use audiobooks to listen to books when they can't put their full attention into reading they may also be gaining an interest in books in general. Overall, although audiobooks may lack some of the charm of traditional books they are still a positive activity and should be encouraged.",21,7,10,0,4,4,4,0,0,4,0.0,0.47619047619047616,0.19047619047619047,0.5303514376996805

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people, even in a democratic nation,  have no responsibilities beyond the immediate ones of taking care of themselves and their families, and fulfilling duties in their neighborhoods and workplaces. So, no, I do not believe in making keeping informed of current events a priority.  In fact, in today's society, increasing numbers of individuals are failing to fulfill their actual responsibilities of feeding and clothing their families, paying their bills, etc.. It's entirely possible that these people who are neglecting their real responsibilities are spending more time online in social networks, and paying more attention to current events as a result. In that case, keeping engaged with 'the world' is not only not helping to make them better citizens, it is actually making them worse, ones given that they are neglecting their legitimate duties.

Assuming that one *is* taking care of their actual responsibilities though, and wishes to become informed on current events, I question the feasibility of doing so. The amount of information is so vast, and it is so difficult to separate the useful information from the useless and even harmful stuff, that I'm uncertain that the average citizen could accomplish that feat even if they wanted to. Just making the effort , and taking the time, to become usefully informed on all current events could prove to be such a tremendous drain on time and resources, that having the time to fulfill one's proper duties might become problematic.

The idea of the good citizen, simply being one who cares enough about society to get informed on what is going on in the world, and then being able to make informed political choices, is an appealing one. But in today's world, with contemporary technology and institutions, I suspect that the achievement of such a citizen is becoming more and more difficult. At best, it might be a state of luxury only attainable by those with limitless time, or resources, or both, such as the idly wealthy, or the retired. In this day and age, the best we can hope for from the typical citizen, is for them to take care of themselves.",17,6,1,0,10,18,12,6,0,12,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.5882352941176471,0.4883177570093458

There are chemical interactions such as pheromones that help you subconsciously choose a mate. There are countless other physical ques that we see or detect on an unconscious level that help us to find our partners.

This time, she wanted to go after the guy and do her best to woe him.

She gets the man's attention but also tears her shorts on the fence. The man laughs and asks if she is ok. The woman tells the man that she has seen him multiple times in town and he was very intriging to her. They had made eye contact multiple times in the past but he never tried to spark any conversation or ask her out. She asks the man if he would be free for dinner one night and he says yea. Well no he says, but yea. What he means is that he is in a long distance relationship in the moment, but things are not going very well. He said he would honestly love to, as he feels his relationship is ending, but it is not officially over yet. If and when the relationship officially ends he will let the woman know.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity ""Matthew."" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity ""Jake."" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful. She was so happy that she didn't notice that Jake was actually Tyler. Soeurette eventually asked Jake to move in with her. But then Jake revealed he had actually been cheating on her with another woman named Emily. Soeurette was furious. Tyler felt guilty for cheating on Soeurette but at the same time he knew that coming clean would make him feel better. So once again he was thrown out of Soeurette's life. Finally, he reentered Soeurette's life as Ben. This time, he was determined to make things right. He was going to be the man that Soeurette deserved. He was going to be the man that she could trust. Ben did all the things that Soeurette expected of a man. He took care of her and loved her fully. Soeurette agreed to marry Ben and they eventually did get married. Soeurette got pregnant again. This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father. He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology can have a bad effect on dating, particularly social media. For one, it makes it easier for people to falsely portray themselves. Instead of focusing on getting to know other people at a deep level, social media has a tendency to encourage people to focus on their own image of surface level appearances and experiences. I think this contributes to unhealthy comparisons between people, which can lead to insecurity and all around unhealthy ways of relating to people. lso, social media makes it easier for people to treat relationships as a commodity.
 It is so often I see people jump from one relationship to the next quickly, each time making a big announcement with photos galore. It seems like it's more about the image they are trying to portray with these than something more authentic. Sometimes. I just don't think these behaviors and ways of thinking are conducive to a good healthy relationship. art of relationship success, in my opinion, comes from deeper lasting rbonds with people that aren't flaunted like a new accessory. The final reason I think social media is harmful to relationships and dating is that it makes people hyper aware of other people's experiences and relationships. I've seen people use it to compare their relationships with others'. No relationship is perfect but what gets posted is usually the good, so people who feel insecure might get a false sense that other relationships are better than theirs. It really can become a tangled web. In sum, no, I don't think social media, in particular, is good at all for dating.

In my opinion, having dating apps like Facebook and Tinder makes dating less fun. It is because I believe that in person communication is best, dating apps are so impersonal. The experience that I have are just so formulaic and a little bit too expected, and there isn't anything spontaneous about it. I also experience a lot of ads, as well as pop-ups. There are also a lot of suggestions from people that I am not interested with.

So one option to improve the general experience in the dating apps, first we need to get rid of the ads, so that we can interact without distractions. I know that we have a lot of paid subscriptions that we pay already, but for people that are willing to pay to use the app, they might as well pay a little more so that we don't have to be bombarded with ads.

Second is to make the experience more personal. Have the users do more of the work, such as writing an introduction or even suggesting that we write our own Instagram-type profile with our photos. Videos, as well as other personal information such as our relationship statuses is also helpful in dating apps. Remember when we were able to listen to music when we visit someone else's Myspace page? I think that needs to come back.

And my last point, is to decrease the overall usage from these dating apps. Technology is a great tool to find someone you're interested with, but it can be a detrimental factor in relationships. If we are too distracted with technology and have no time to spend with the person we were just matched, then there is no point of having technology in the first place.

So, in conclusion, I think technology and the dating apps are helpful in finding great and lasting relationships, but there are some things that need to be addressed if we want to have real connections with the people we like. We need to remove the ads and pop-ups, make the profiles personal, and make sure that the dating apps are only used by the individuals who want to be connected, not confused about too many presumptions. This way, people will be more likely to go out with each other instead of being too dependent on technology in their every day lives.

In my opinion, people are not being good citizens if they make no effort to keep up with the news. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and that it is our responsibility as citizens to be informed. 

Informed citizens make better decisions that benefit everyone because they have more knowledge about the lives of other people. This can even be beneficial for people in need. When folks are informed about a community in need through the news or some other source, only then can they act. 

It's also good for citizens to keep up with what's current so they can be a more active and involved participant in their own government. It's hard to vote for how your community should be represented if you don't know a thing about the issues affecting your community. I don't see how someone could be a good citizen if they don't care enough about their fellow citizens to see what is affecting everyone. Engaging with current events is the only way to do this, so yes. We ARE being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news.

In my opinion, paying student-athletes would not ruin college sports, at least not anymore than it has been ruined. The NCAA is a business, and the players are the product. College leagues are supposed to be amateur, but the NCAA is a billion dollar business. It functions as a recruitment organization for the NFL and NBA, and has done this for years, and it is a money-making machine. Paying student-athletes would merely be a way to pay the people going through the long, minor-league, recruitment and training process. That is, it would be a way to pay the people who are engaged in a process that amounts to a very long hiring selection period.

It's not just the leagues, and how they function as a recruitment organization for the pros, though. It's also the college teams themselves. College sports make schools tons of money. Tickets to college games are expensive, and the schools make a lot of money from selling tickets. Some of these tickets are as highly demanded as the tickets to the Super Bowl. Also, the teams indirectly bring in a lot of money through merchandise, and the sale of TV rights, and through the alumni donations that are often tied to the success of the team. It might be fair to say that at colleges with very good professional teams, the school itself, and the education it provides, are secondary to the sports team. They're kind of a parasitic entity that sponges off the revenue generated by the team (among other sources), and it's only right that the players, who are in fact, supporting the school, should get a piece of the pie.

It's not unfair to say that college sports shouldn't be a business. It's not unfair to say there's too much emphasis on them, and that they're more important to the schools than they  should be, and that education is being sacrificed for the sake of sports. It's reasonable to argue that all of this should change, and that college sports should be more about education, and less about money. But it's unreasonable to punish the players, who are the workers supporting this entire business model. Perhaps college sports should be separated from the rest of the college experience, but until they are, student-athletes are merely the workers in a business that makes a lot of money, and they should be paid accordingly.",28,9,3,1,15,24,19,5,0,19,0.03571428571428571,0.10714285714285714,0.5714285714285714,0.448943661971831

In my opinion, I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would somehow ruin college sports. I feel if the athletes generate so much attention and publicity that they are benefiting the bottom line of a university, then it's only fair that they should get a share of that benefit. 
I also think that paying college athletes would not necessarily cause a bidding war.
 There could be alternative ways of compensating them that don't involve unequal payments that would allow them to bid on the athletes in the first place. 
I disagree with the author's point that paying college athletes would distort the economics of college sports. because, as I previously stated, they could develop a system that works fairly and treats the athletes equally. It may change the economics slightly by improving a system but this is not a bad thing. The athletes work hard and deserve their share of pay.

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

I looked at the letter and couldn't believe what I was reading. How could JFK be writing me a letter. He has been dead for years. His death was confirmed and even seen on video. This obviously is a prank but who would do something so disgusting?

I tried to go about the rest of my day but I can't lie. The letter kept popping up in my head. I had to figure out who was pranking me. I was the President of the United States for 8 years. If JFK was actually alive I would have heard about it from the Secret Service. I went to bed and the next day when I woke up that letter was still on my mind.

I decided to give the number a call. A male voice picked up and told me that I'd be transferred to JFK. After about 15 seconds a voice said to me ""Hi Barack, it's John F Kennedy."" I told the voice on the other end of the phone that obviously this is a joke and I was about to hang up. The voice told me to wait and said he had proof.

About 15 seconds later I checked my phone and I saw a picture of this man. He looked like JFK. He took a picture of his old license. He had old family photos. I still was pretty sure this was a prank but I wanted to see how far it would go.

I asked JFK why he left me his number and want he needed my help with. JFK explained that he wanted me to come visit a secret island that he was stationed on. He has some new technology that I might want to check out.

He has been designing technology that will allow the United States to take over the entire world. He said he had been planning this for his entire career but he had to do it in secrecy. That is why he had to stage his own death. He had to get away and get off the grid in order to get this work done.

I explained to JFK that I really appreciate the offer but I can't visit. I would have to fly with the Secret Service as I am a previous President as well. That would not go over well and could possibly blow up his spot. You tell JFK to keep in touch and he tells you he will.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypical boy-obsessed women are the type of character that is hard to watch/read about.   I don't mind the occasional girl who is obsessed with a boy, but when it's the main focus of the story, I get annoyed. Mostly because it tends to create over simple characters, and it's not realistic. There are women (and men) that become obsessed with dating or being paired with a partner. But when the reasons why, or the characters background, are not explored, or when the girl getting the boy (or whatever gender combination) is the simple way to a happy ending it seems like a waste of a character.   I think that there are a lot of people who are obsessed with their love lives, but I don't think that it's the only thing that defines them. And when characters are one dimensional their don't function well as characters and fail to be relatable. And if you can't relate to a character, whether loving them, hating them, or just understanding them, then it hurts the story. And any messages, lessons, and most of the enjoyment of the story is lost.

And specifically, I think using this particular stereotype is a problem that goes past just being able to get something out of the work. It also reinforces real world stereotypes. When the happy ending is the obsessed woman getting the man (boy, girl, other woman) it makes it seem like women are only good for one thing, and that's being a wife or girlfriend. And this, at least today, is still seen as acceptable. And it's not. At least the assumption is not. It takes away from the choice of a woman to choose relationships over other things; like they never made that choice it just happened to them as the natural order. So it hurts not only women who make the opposite choice, but also the women who are focused primarily on relationships, and all types of women in between.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" And the 92nd little pig was like, ""no, dude."" The wolf asked the pig, ""Where did you get the depleted uranium from to build this house? I'm not going to eat you if you tell me."" And the 92nd little pig said, ""I found it in the desert."" And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm not going to eat you if you tell me where in the desert you found it."" And the 92nd little pig said, ""I found it in the desert near the nuclear testing grounds."" The pig said, ""Just go 20 miles up north into the Frowling Mountain, climb to the top, and you'll see a big building that is the nuclear testing grounds.

Well, I'm going back home to make my pig costume and then I'll head up to the nuclear testing grounds in Frowling Mountain in a few days."" ""Good luck!"" said the pig.

A few days later the wolf did exactly as he said he was going to do and after he made his pig costume out of old pig skins that he shed off of some poor pigs that he killed, he headed up to the nuclear testing building at the top of Frowling Mountain. He took one day to get there and then a whole day to get to the top. Once he got to the top, he saw the nuclear testing grounds was so excited and relieved that it was really true. He went to what appeared to be the front door, knocked on the door, and then the door opened.

He thought that was kind of strange but didn't think too much of it and walked right in. He saw a bunch of pigs and a pig in a lab coat. His mouth was becoming so watery now because he was salivating at the thought of eating all of these pigs. Then a really big pig, the biggest one he's ever seen goes up to him and says, ""Welcome to the nuclear testing grounds."" The wolf said, ""Thank you. Now I've come to do what I set out to do today."" He tore off his pig clothing and said, ""Now I'm going to eat all of you pigs!"" 

As soon as he started chasing all of the pigs they abruptly stopped running, turned around, and to the wolf's horror they ripped off all of their pig skin from their bodies only to reveal a group of hungry, snarling and salivating lions. Then the biggest pig who he saw moments earlier ripped off his pig skin in one swoop and towered over the wolf with a great big hungry smile. The wolf was cowering his body lower and lower in pure fear and horror and that's when the group of lions started saying, ""I'll huff and puff and I'll eat your body now!"" 

And right when the wolf started to yell, there was a super bright flash of light that blinded all of them and then, boom! A nuclear explosion went off and the wolf and lions were all dead. Just outside of the radius of the explosion was the pig who made the nuclear bomb explode and kill all of them. He was so happy because he was able to save all of the pigs and the wolf was dead.

The government had to act fast.
 After sixty years the side effects had been realized. You could not die form old age (you could still die from other things like accidents, murder, etc.), but you become sterile and can no longer reproduce. The people that did not take the drug that died off and the others that were too old to reproduce would be no help at ensuring any more population on the planet. The government had to find a way to keep the population going. Should they genetically produce citizens? How would that work? Would they be considered human? Would they be given the drug? If so, when?
The government decided to do something that would have been considered unthinkable before.
 They decided to make and antidote for the ""immortality drug"" offering people the hope that maybe the sterilization effect could be reversed. Some people were against it completely. They wanted to be immortal and did not want to risk the chance of having their immortality taken away. Others did not want the pressure of being the ""last generation and were willing to take the risk. After the first round of antidote was given out people found that there was no reversing the sterility. Now the people that had taken the drug were sterile and aging like they had never taken the drug. This led to massive revolts and war. Eventually both the mortals and immortals destroyed each other and now no human is left. It turns out, not even immortality is forever.",26,3,18,0,5,10,5,5,0,5,0.0,0.6923076923076923,0.19230769230769232,0.5013698630136987

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

While I have not personally experienced period shaming or period poverty, I have witnessed such incidents first hand when I attended high school, and middle school as well. I think it is a negative outcome for female students, that personally affects them psychologically, and for a long period of time. Ideally , girls should be able to buy and receive whatever products they might need for their menstruation without any worry. Schools should step in and help this natural process of life that female students go through. For many students, it can be a daunting endeavor to understand the process of which pads or tampons to buy. For others, poverty can affect whether they can buy menstrual process on a constant and regular basis. Thus, providing free pads and tampons can help limit the period shaming, and period poverty that female students are regularly subject to.

Tampons and Pads are much similar to Band-Aids and similar items provided by the school. For example, they are hygienic items like soap and toilet paper, intended to make the user clean and avoid appearing unhygienic. Like Band-Aids, they stop bleeding for a period of time and as long as one continues to wear them, and they have to be changed out every while. I am sure that students would appreciate seeing them in the school, just as they would any other supply readily available in school. However, unlike Band-Aids and other items, their ought to be a better sense of privacy for the students requesting tampons and pads. For example, there should not be any announcement in an auditorium or over the intercom that the student need pads or tampons, and ideally the school would not keep a record of such, allowing the students to remain anonymous when requesting the pads and receiving them. Through that, they can receive the tampons and pads they require, without feeling judged for doing so and potentially being stigmatized for what is effectively a natural and commonplace occurrence. 

Schools ought to be a place where students feel comfortable and able to learn and develop as individuals. Providing tampons and pads are a critically way for schools to do so for female students. By offering them in a private and respectful way, schools can give comfort and stability for students undergoing their period, that otherwise might be judged and ridiculed for lacking access to such supplies.",23,7,12,0,4,6,5,1,2,3,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.17391304347826086,0.4497816593886463

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypical characters in fiction are as old as fiction itself. Fiction is intrinsically based on stereotypes and generalizations about people or situations, because it is a way of condensing life into some kind of literary, visual, or auditory shorthand that is much easier to consume for the reader. Stereotypes are very much a part of this, because creating an archetype or an archetype package for a character is a quick way for readers to be able to define that character in their mind as a character representing a certain group or circumstances. Without stereotypes, fiction can be very difficult to write, and too long-winded for readers to bother with.

Of course, this doesn't mean that using stereotypes is entirely acceptable. Some stereotypes, such as dated racial or cultural ones , have grown so outdated through changing times that they're now universally viewed as offensive. Examples of this are black characters once considered benign, and cheerful, like Stepin Fetchit, Aunt Jemima or Uncle Remus, who are now considered offensive racial stereotypes no one in their right mind would create. Similar ones include characters once seen as heroic, like Tonto and the Lone Ranger, who are now seen as bigoted and politically incorrect.

This isn't because stereotyping in fiction is bad, though. It's simply because of the way history, cultures and values change over time. Many of today's stories, though they bend over backwards to be 'politically correct' and 'non-problematic' have stereotypes.  The 'bad father', the 'overworked single mother', the 'depressed woman with a cat', the 'female character who is more capable, smarter, and morally virtuous than any of the male characters' are all examples of modern stereotypes that are acceptable now, but will one day doubtless be viewed as offensive, dated, and in bad taste, to the same extent Uncle Remus is now.

So I personally, accept stereotypes in fiction, and would never turn down or run from a book or a film because of its presence. I try to see beyond the stereotype. to the universal story that the writer is attempting to tell, and encourage other readers and viewers to approach stereotypes in fiction in a similar manner.",19,4,4,1,10,23,19,4,0,19,0.05263157894736842,0.21052631578947367,0.5789473684210527,0.5696517412935324

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude what's with the funky house."" 
And the 92nd little pig was like, ""dude, what's your problem.""
And the wolf was like, ""dude, I'm just saying, it's kind of a funky house.""
The 92nd little pig agreed, it was a bit unusual to built a house out of deplete uranium, but it was what they had at hand.
""Well, are you going to try to enter my house or not?"", replied the pig from the comfort of their home.

The wolf looked up and down the house, and paused before speaking, ""I don't know man, it's kind of weird."" The wolf was usually accustomed to breaking in to typical houses, made up of wood, brick, or some other cheap material. But depleted uranium was a whole other matter, it was certainly much more sturdier than the previous houses they had broken into.
""Well, I'm going to bed, you can try to break in if you want, but I'm not going to be up for a

The wolf still outside, looked up at the house, and thought about how to get in. They blew on the doors, the outside walls, and even tried scratching the windows, all seemingly resistant to his claws and might. He tried climbing up the house, but found himself loosing his grip and unable to reach the roof. The wolf was getting frustrated, he had usually entered a past household by now. 
The wolf decided to try a different approach.
 He saw the ground, and dug deep into the dirt. Surely he could tunnel into the house if he could not break down its doors, he thought. But upon digging deep into the soil, he struck the house's foundation, and found that it too was made up of depleted uranium. Drat, the wolf thought, he was not going to get into the house. The wolf then decided to head elsewhere, hoping to find a home they could break into, one that was not made of depleted uranium.

Sure enough, the 92nd little pig woke up early next morning, feeling very refreshed. They slept soundly, and noted that the wolf had failed on entering their home. They went outside to see if the wolf was still around, and found him gone. They were relieved, there home was safe from the wolf after all. So they went back in and started breakfast. While they had lived in fear in the past, scared of all threats and scares their mother would warn him and his siblings before they left the home to make their own, they were now confident that they could live in peace, without fear of the wolf or any other predator.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.
 I like this benefit personally because I have a partner who goes to bed very early. With an audiobook, I can still sit in the same room and enjoy it without waking him up by turning on the light.

School is primarily a place for young adults and students to develop their social skills, and also foster growth into their talents, interests, and strengths. chool is a lsopa lace where students can learn amore abouh te world around them, and also learn how to interact with others.
 While students may learn content and information that is less useful and more situational, the benefits of school are still present as students ought to learn how to think more in depth in what information is given to them, to be more analytical and purposeful in their actions as well. 
In my opinion, the most important thing sI earn edin school is how to think critically.
 That is, to think more in depth of what I learned, and to analyze it further. This includes being able to apply the knowledge in other areas in my life, to also apply the information with other knowledge I learn or already know. I think this is the most important thing I learned in school because it will help me in my future career, and also in my everyday life. Being able to think critically helps me in any kind of job, as it helps me identify which information is useful, and potentially think of more effective and creative means of accomplishing a task. It also helps me in my everyday life, as I can apply the skill in other areas of my life, such as my hobbies and interests. Thinking critically helps me identify when information is falsified, and potentially inaccurate. It gives me an initiative to learn more about the topic, and to also learn more about the subject matter. That way I avoid claiming what I read or heard about as accurate, when it may as well be false and misleading. This is true of what claims is posted on social media, but also what I hear from people in person, and in the conversations that I hold. Thinking critically goes hand to hand with the ability to being flexible in ones beliefs, as you should reconsider positions when information is learned that changes how you view things, and that is more alligned with your informed beliefs and perceptions. 

Overall, I think thinking more in depth regarding the world around me and effectively thinking critically is something I will continue to use in the future. It helps me in my work, where I am to analyze information and create reports from it. It helps in my personal interests, for me to be better informed in my choices to avoid mistakes, as well as misinforming others about false claims or information. For that, I think it is one of the thing students ideally should learn from school. I think as connected as people are in today's world, it is useful for many to be able to think critically on what they read and hear about on social media and other outlets. Many issues will be avoided if people are able to perceive false information as such, and they would be able to inform themselves properly to make decisions that affects not only themselves, but the lives of others as well.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, as long as the activity in question is reasonably regulated and you choose to participate knowing the risks, then it should not be called too dangerous to be considered a sport. There are risks involved in all sports—if you decide it's too dangerous and don't participate, then that's OK. But if you are going to participate, you should know what risks there are. I would much rather experience a risky and high-stakes sport, compete at it with others, than never have had the opportunity to do something that sometimes pushes me to my limits

If an activity is putting people in a position where they are forced to engage in it by the government or a governing athletic organization, then I
 have a problem with it.  Some Eastern Asian and African countries come to mind, where athletes are occasionally compelled to compete. There are recent stories of athletes being forced to compete despite a legitimate injury, and being punished if they don't, and even worse, having their families punished by their communities when they refuse. 
In the western world, we want individuals to participate voluntarily, safely and with respect for rules, communities and nature.
 For example, snorkeling at a tropical reef might be a relatively safe activity, but you better understand the dangers of rip tides and sharks. In this case, it is appropriate to get training and expect reasonable regulation. 

et's take a look at the reality of a dangerous sport like BASE jumping.
 From 1997 to 2002, fatalities averaged nearly one fatality every two weeks. The average BASE jumper has a nearly 50 percent likelihood of dying or being seriously injured over the course of a lifetime of jumping. So why do people continue to jump? Some jumpers say it is for the thrill, others because they value the freedom of parachuting on their own terms and don't want to be encumbered by gravity, and others simply want to experience flight without a plane. 
I contend that these are good reasons and enough to support this activity as a sport.
   In fact, one could argue that the seriousness of the risk makes it more fun and adventurous to many people. If BASE jumping were as safe as golf, there wouldn't be the attraction for some to give it a try. 
So is it selfish to participate in risky sports?
 That depends on how you want to look at it. I believe you need to make an informed choice and understand the risks. Be smart about it, but don't be afraid to pursue your dreams and desires. ",26,5,1,2,18,26,24,2,4,20,0.07692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.7692307692307693,0.515625

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, you are not a bad citizen if you do not keep up with the news.  The news can be very depressing to watch.  Certain people may not be able to handle the mental stress that comes from constantly watching the news.  The news rarely covers good or uplifting stories.  Most of the stories are focused on crime, disasters, and negative situations.

he news can deceive some people by making them believe that all of society is bad and horrible.
  It can present a sensationalize view of the world.  For example, if a plane crashes, then there will be constant news coverage of the plane crash.  We have 24-hour news channels that will constantly cover the plane crash.  People who are highly influenced by the news may then think that airplanes are not safe to be on.  This is despite that the fact airplane crashes are generally very rare.  

I think there are certain types of people that just don't react well to the news.  They are best focusing on the issues directly affecting them in their lives.   

Ultimately, our number one responsibility in life is to take care of ourselves.  Anything else is good, but not a necessity.   You aren't a bad person if you don't keep up with the news.  In fact, you can still keep up with current events by talking with people.  Engaging with people who have actually experienced the current events may help certain people grasp them better.  

We live during a time where the distrust of news seems to be at a high.  Are there moral implications intertwined with keeping up with the news?  No.  Whether you are good or bad citizen should not be based on whether you watch the news.   ",28,6,19,0,3,6,3,3,3,0,0.0,0.6785714285714286,0.10714285714285714,0.4861111111111111

I almost spat the bee right there because I was so scared of it having the capability to talk. I examined the bee. I realized it wasn't possible for it to talk. I examined it further, almost close to my eye I see that it has robotic parts. This bee is not a living creature. It's a robot!

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the math and the sciences are the most important things students should learn in school. My biology teacher have said that the things you learn in math class aren't used in the real world and she may be biased because she was teaching biology, but mathematics as a subject is very important. It is the foundation for society-advancing careers such as engineering, science, and medicine. Without mathematics, we would not have the mental knowledge how to build computers, artificial intelligence, devices, and so much more.

The sciences are also a vast majority of topics, and the same thing with mathematics, is that it is a very essential part of learning and pathways to a successful future. In these current times with the pandemic, the world is in need of more scientists to find a cure, and without the sciences, they would not be able to do so.

But there's one thing that I have been noticing over the years and something that I regret talking about. Human empathy, compassion, and love for one another has been lacking in our communities for the past few years. Don't get me wrong, we have our heroes such as our healthcare workers, teachers, and police officers, but there's something that we are lacking in our society. People are protesting against mask mandates, against the vaccine, and against various heath protocols. But not only that, people are also being killed, being yelled at, and being discriminated against. I think that in school, there should be something that we teach about these things and so the future generation do not have to go through the same things that we are going through.

I deeply think that we need mathematics and science to progress the world forward. But in the meantime, the most important thing is to teach students about empathy and belonginess. Teach them on how to be accepting of one another and to be helpful with one another.

In my opinion, I believe that people think animals are so innocent and they cannot fend for themselves. Humans are a scum race and they are on top of the food chain and can actually protect themselves from abuse or beatings and can actually do something about it. Sometimes and not always there is always the human is beaten and therefore deserved, but a dog is almost always innocent and cannot do anything about the beatings if its coming from the owner or an abusive person. There is also the saying that a dog is a mans best friend so that means that dogs are almost always innocent . But i believe that people should also be concerned about humans being beaten because sometimes it can come from a situation they cannot get out of like domestic violence and sometimes needs the help that they desire but cannot get it. People in the whole are scumbags and are not to be trusted so i could see why humans prefer a human to be beaten with a bat rather than a dog because dogs aver very defenseless. But i also believe if its gonna go both ways the government should also do more to protect humans the public as a whole.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, sports that are extreme such as mountain climbing, rafting, spelunking and others that involve the possibility of injury or even death are not reasonable to promote as a sporting endeavor. I fully support it and fully support people calling it a sport and participating in this sport. What I do not support, is people not taking safety into account and people not planning for an event where the chance of injury, or death, is very high.

We all know the story where a father or a mother dies from an extreme sport. They have left their children and their partner behind to fend for themselves. It's easy to say that it's their own fault and everyone knows the risks, but what about for those left behind and questioning whether or not it was worth it? The mental-readiness of the people these athletes may leave behind is something to consider. ot only that, but when they are not there for them anymore, people in loved ones lives may slowly start to fade away as well.
 Depression, self-harming, pointless violence and suicide are all possible consequences for the people who remain behind when they are gone. So the first thing I want for people if they are going to participate in extreme sports, is that to prepare their loved ones to be ready whenever there will be an event that could cause death.

Second is insurance and inheritance that would be left by the athlete participating in extreme sports. It is absolutely necessary that they have insurance of the highest quality, because there's a possibility that the death of the athlete might not be covered, leaving out members of their family to suddenly face a large unpaid bill or worse, a life without financial support. What if their very young children would be left with nothing? What if individuals who are in debt to the athlete have to pay their dues on purpose to receive it back?

It may sound as a very big burden and I may sound that I do not support extreme sports, but in actuality I do. But at the same time, I do want those participating to take these issues into account because there really is no reason why innocent people should suffer in the process. Because yes, a family left behind without any financial support for the rest of their young lives are going to suffer, and they would suffer badly. So, my tip with people wanting to participate in extreme sports is very simple. Plan for it beforehand. Talk with your family. Talk with your insurance, talk with your lawyer, and plan and prepare for yourself to be able to leave behind those you love especially with your father or mother who may be missing you the most.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

The most important thing students should learn in school is how to be independent. They should learn how to take care of themselves and not rely on others. They should also learn how to be responsible for their actions. 

School is the first time many children leave their parents for a meaningful period of time. It's the perfect opportunity to learn about independence, and to begin to be responsible.

Independence affects every aspect of our lives. It is important to be able to take care of yourself and not rely on others. If you can't do that, then you will have a hard time in life. You will have to rely on others for everything. You will repeatedly have to ask for help and you won't be able to do anything on your own. Your dependency will limit your enjoyment, restrict your options. 


esponsibility is also very important.
  You will learn about the consequences of your actions.  If you are responsible for your actions, then you will be able to learn from your mistakes and not make the same mistake twice, while having a real stake in the outcome. 

Teachers and adults should be teaching students how to be independent and responsible.   I learned how to be independent and responsible from my parents. They gave me chances to fail, so that I could learn. They taught me how to take care of myself and be responsible for my actions.  

I learned that asking for help is fine, but that there is a joyous freedom in being able to do things for yourself. 
Getting gifts is a good feeling, but being able to do things for yourself is a better feeling.  There's no comparison for the feeling of buying your first car, with money you've earned yourself. 
IBing independent and responsible is the best way to live.
  It's much less stressful, and very empowering.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, it's not right to pay college athletes. College athletes are already getting a free education, and they are also getting the opportunity to play in front of thousands of fans. They are then often going to be recruited and make a lot of money after college. There's a lot of issues paying them would bring up. The fact it could cause bidding wars. Colleges could be trying to spend money they don't have to recruit. There's many different reasons. However, it's just not fair is my main argument. Athletes get every advantage. The rules don't apply to them. Now they get to be paid money to go to college? 

As a society, we need to encourage artists and people like that more. All of this money going to athletes could easily be going to arts programs or other things. Those are important to the world. They don't bring in money like sports do but artists are no less important. 

We need to just focus on treating everyone equal in college. We need to focus on the education. That's what college is about in the first place. It wasn't created to be a place where athletes can start making money even earlier. If we start going down that road then will college even be about education later on? Maybe at some point it will just be a place for athletes to go to make money and be recruited. Sometimes following the money isn't the right thing. This is one of those cases. 

Athletes already have every advantage given to them. Lets choose not to ruin the foundations of college just to give them even more power.

---

In my opinion, it is absolutely a must that we consider extreme sports like mountain climbing to be real sports. We have gone too far in our obsession with safety and in this case I think we have stopped athletes from achieving their full potential. Anyone going in with any dangerous sports already have learned about the risks and dangers associated with it, so why be overly cautious?

It's on you, the athlete who fail to prepare or neglect to respect risks, not the organizers who incorporate safety measures. It's also not on spectators that have paid, and paid a great deal of money to go support and watch the athletes do what they love. It's on you, the athlete who failed to get any sort of life insurance to keep their loved ones protected just in case of the unlikely event of an accident happening.

If we don't consider sports like mountain climbing, parachuting, skydiving, running with the bulls, etc to be a real sport then it's going to be a sad day when we hit a patch of very mundane and very uninteresting sports. What are we going to watch instead? E-sports? Where ""athletes"" are just sitting on their computer and mouse and keyboard and doing absolutely nothing except for playing a video game? We hear those commentators say things like, ""the character killed about 15 people in one match,"" and we call that a sport? Just give me a break.

I know I sound a little bit angry, but wouldn't you be? I've read our history books when there were no safety involved and people just went all in, doing whatever they felt like doing. We did not get stories about plain old men dying of chest injuries incurred during sports because the protective chest plates was too heavy to come with them everywhere, or protectors were not available, no. We heard stories of mighty men overcoming their fears and coming out on top. Stories like those helped shape our culture, and those stories are sometimes what we want to emulate. Stories of overcoming something despite the odds or because of the odds, that's what makes for a powerful tale. If we stopped trying, if we stopped taking risks or stopped offering them, then aren't we depriving ourselves of knowing what the meaning of challenge really is?

If our mentality is focused on safety, we would not have gotten to the moon, we would not have airplanes, we would not have cellphones, and the world would be a pretty boring place because people took it safe.

 David is then forced to flee from the aliens, and he soon meets up with a group of other people who are also Mana Sensitives. Together, they form a resistance against the aliens, and try to find a way to defeat them. This group aims to save all of humanity from these aliens and must work together to do so. They hope to use their mana sensitive powers to build the strength of their group even stronger. 

With a group of mana sensitive survivors, not even an entire world of aliens would be able to defeat them. The larger they can get their group, the faster they can take over. The main goal is to remain safe from large numbers of aliens until they can strengthen their group. They must travel to a variety of places to do this because there can be survivors all around the world. So far, there are ten of them, and with these ten they have the power to run an entire country. The world is what they are seeking however. David can be viewed as a little power hungry sometimes, but ultimately just wants to save the world from the aliens. He is aware of the strength of the mana sensitive, but also knows that they need to remember to be cautious. he aliens are a threat to the mana sensitive, but also to the entire world.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toilet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toilet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies. Kids lie though, they cheat, steal and cause trouble with everything they have at their disposal. So why would we give them more things to cause trouble with?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, the primary difference between listening and reading is the level of interaction one has with the book. 
When you read, you are the one creating the images in your head.
 The pace is your own. The descriptions, the tone, the characters' voices, all are part of your creation. Your emotions and actions are very much your own.   You are both a reader and a participant in the story. You decide how much, if at all, you interact with the characters and both their conversations and actions.

When you are listening to an audiobook, your level of interaction is very different.   Instead of creating the images for yourself, you are using the reader's voice and intonations to create a mental picture. The mood, tone, inflections, and interpretation have already been done for you by the voice artist. You are a listener, rather than a player. The voice artist is the one creating a mental picture for you, taking away the ability to create your own. 
There are some levels in which this can be good.
 For instance, you may not be able to read because you are visually impaired and cannot see the words. Or if you struggle with a short attention span or problems focusing, listening may work better for you. Or perhaps you simply don't like reading, or it is just more convenient to listen.  One downside of listening is that you cannot speed up or slow down the voice artist's reading. It is even possible that you might dislike the voice of the narrator, which makes it impossible to listen to. 

Either way,   listening to a book can give you a similar experience of reading, and it is great for encouraging children to read.

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are every bit as good as reading a book, and possibly superior to reading in some respects. For starters, audiobooks are useful when driving, strolling in the park, cooking, cleaning, or doing any other activity that requires you to be able to see what you 're doing rather than focusing on a a book. Books offer no corresponding advantage, as the main activity that audiobooks might prevent, listening to music or other audio, is something that would also prevent the level of focus required to read a book. That brings up another advantage of audiobooks, the fact that they not only free up our eyes, but don't require the same level of focus that reading does. It's possible to attempt to read a book, and end up unable to follow what's going on and getting distracted and losing your place, while with an audiobook, you might well be able to make your way through the recording without getting distracted, and still retain what's going on in the story.

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself.

Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available. Not everyone has a tablet, and many people attempting to read e-books on public transit or on trains experience difficulties like motion sickness, while doing so, either due to the glare on their screen or just the general inconvenience of reading while moving. Also, audiobooks enable us to tune out distractions while listening to them on headphones in public settings like mass transit, whereas books lack the ability to do that.

In closing, audiobooks are in no regard worse than books, and in many ways, better. If I were forced to choose one over the other, I'd have to say that, for me, as well as most people, the myriad extra benefits of listening to audiobooks would more than compensate for any loss that the lack of a printed page could entail.",20,7,1,1,11,22,19,3,0,19,0.05,0.05,0.6,0.501010101010101

In my opinion, many of the subjects in school are not directly related to someones life. I would look at high school more of a way to prepare young adults for their future and life on their own as opposed to preparing them for college. All the more advanced types of maths and sciences arent all that beneficial to many of the lives of students, especially those who plan on working after graduation. The classes i feel should be implemented more often stem around life skills, and mental health. I believe there should be an entire class on finances in my opinion. An entire marking period or semester spent on credit, one spent on investing and saving, one spent on debt and saving, etc. Just more life skills over the general education types of courses. Not only this but i think nutrition should be taught in a much more in depth way. I think itd be a great idea to teach about foods as a way to heal your body, like medicine. This can tie into mental health. Instead of looking for drugs to feel better and less anxious, how about trying some magnesium. Maybe eating a higher fat diet will slow your mind down anxiety wise, eating more pastured eggs, or nutritious foods like raw milk, organ meats, fatty fish, etc. The most important thing i learned in school personally had nothing to do with any of my classes. The thing i learned was simply about myself and how i interact with other people. I was often uncomfortable in school because i was being forced to act a certain way in a classroom full of kids. I learned that i was insecure in certain ways, and confident in certain ways. It helped my future because i knew where i needed to grow personally, and i realized what i could do to help myself through my own research. I think the best thing about school is the environment, and the helpful people you meet and can learn from.   I think the worst things are the forced agenda, the tests and the stress involved with all of it. The school system is very structured and for people who are outliers and different it can really harm their minds. I grew up with ADHD, so i always viewed this as a crutch growing through school because i was different and disabilitied in that environment.

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problem almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books can be read in a monotonous or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks? In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

Audiobooks are a beacon of equal rights and equal access for the disabled, and as such should be subsidized and expanded.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, prioritizing the well-being of animals over that of our fellow humans, is not only wrong, but also immoral. Human life should normally be viewed as more valuable to us than animal life. We are, after all, human beings. Do dogs, or deer, think that human life is more valuable than their own? The concept is laughable. It's natural to care more about our own species than others, and in general, to feel more empathy for those who are more similar to us. Beyond that, humans are intrinsically more valuable than animals. Humans are the species that is most capable of rational thought, of self-awareness, of empathy, of language, and of course, of feeling pain. Suffering humans suffer far more than animals do, and therefore, should be given priority.  Viewed in this light, it's almost monstrous that someone would care more about the suffering of an animal than that of a human.

So there are powerful reasons why we should care more for the pain of humans than animal pain. The question becomes , then, why do so many of our fellow humans care more for the suffering of animals? I would propose that the answer to this is that they are not really concerned with the suffering of animals, but rather, with their own feelings. They're incapable of caring for anyone else's feelings, human or animal. These people in fact, hate other humans, who they consider to be a distraction from the only thing that's important - themselves - and are only concerned with the suffering of animals because by bringing it up, they can re-direct the attention of others, back towards the truly important topic - them.

In short, the phenomenon of caring more for animal suffering than the plight of humans, is a form of malignant narcissism. The appropriate response is not to try to understand the narcissist, or to help them, since personality disorders are generally not responsive to therapy. The appropriate response is to ignore them.",24,7,3,0,14,21,16,5,0,16,0.0,0.125,0.5833333333333334,0.47045454545454546

Obama had initially believed it was all an elaborate dream, it was unlikely that he would be abducted by aliens for such a peaceful interaction. As he stood up, still feeling dazed, Obama noticed the statue on his desk. It was the same statue as the one he had been given in his dream. The alien statue, upon closer inspection was quite detailed and showed excellent craftsmanship. It would be a shame, he thought to himself, if he did not give it to a qualified scientist for study. Taking a picture of it and storing it on his computer, he then went out to visit the White House.

There, he handed over the statue the White House researchers, who then took it to the lab underneath the White House. They spent the next days analyzing its composition, discovering a new element in the process. They also found the means to create the new element, which could in time be used to develop new technology for mankind. The aliens had given humanity a gift to use to advance even further. Perhaps, Obama thought, it was from the trust they had in humans, to use the alien statue for the greater good and to even one day travel the stars to find other alien civilizations.",26,1,17,1,7,20,8,12,1,7,0.038461538461538464,0.6538461538461539,0.3076923076923077,0.46153846153846156

Mom, a bee landed on me and actually spoke. My mother dismissed my seemingly preposterous story and told me to go back to my room and play. I did as I was told, but I couldn't stop thinking about that bee. I am certain that bee spoke to me. I wonder if it will happen again if I were to open the window a little wider? 
I opened the window and waited.

Sire, the kingdom is being attacked by hornets, we need you to come back and take your rightful place as our king and help defend our hive. I was very confused. The one thing I knew for certain was that the bees did not intend to sting me but only wanted my help which I did not know how to give. I ran to my mother again and told her what happened. This time she sat me down and told me about my past. I was once the proud ruler of billions of bees. I was the king to every queen of every hive in the known land. Then the day came where my life was in danger from within. There was a plot by the military ants to kill me and take over the kingdom. So they used an experimental technology on me that transferred my consciousness into a being that can process all the information a bee is able to in its small but very compact brain. So they put me into this young boy with my parents permission. They knew their son would be fine and they also knew how important it was for me to hide in this way. 

The day finally came where the bee scientists came to my room, connected a device behind my ear and transferred my consciousness into a finely dressed bee that was laying besides me. After the transfer, the king bee rose and flew off with his followers and mounted an unparalleled resistance to beat off the hornet invasion that threatened the bee king's kingdom.

You never knew how the aliens were defeated, you just knew that there was an enormous flash in the sky.   It was the only thing that could have saved you, you later discovered, because whatever that flash was, it killed all of them, while leaving most of the remaining Earthlings alive.

You had always just assumed that it was some secret new weapon that the military had developed, but the more time that passes, the more you realize that the military had been wiped out just like the rest of the world.  
The survivors have begun to find that they have the ability to manipulate the energy that the aliens had been using to attack them.
  In fact, it was a small convent of self-proclaimed witches that actually combined their powers and blasted all of the aliens out of the sky.
The witches were the only ones who had the power to do it, and tyuckily for the rest of us, they were some of the few who survived the invasion.  

These witches became the benevolent dictators of Earth, and most of you accepted their unchecked power.  At the very least, you all thought, the alien energies will soon be gone, and we'll all go back to normal.  Without their powers, the witches will just have to hold elections like we used to do in the good old days.  
But you were wrong.
  They got most of their power from the aliens, but they also discovered that Earth itself had magical powers.  These powers had always existed, but they were too weak when they divided up among billions of primates.  With only a few hundred thousand people left on Earth, anyone who tries hard enough can wield magical powers.
The witches had discovered that they could manipulate the Earth's magical energies, and they had begun to do so.
  Luckily, they were good witches, so they always did so with good intentions, but we are humans after all, and many of us disagreed.

Everyone with any kind of an agenda tried to use magic to attain their wishes, and other groups used magic to fight against them.  

Eventually, however, we settled into a two-party system.  There were good witches, and there were wicked witches.  Not surprisingly, the good witches agreed to hold elections.  The wicked witches tried to stop people from voting, but they were only successful about half of the time.  
The good witches had ainitially een the ones who had the most power, but now that everyone had magic, the wicked witches were able to use
 it as well.  When the wicked witches were in power, sometimes they had good intentions, and sometimes they just ruled with cruelty.

  Power shifts back and forth, and no one can seem to figure out that the other side is actually the evil one.  

At least people aren't literally killing themselves over it, like we used to do before the invasion, back in the bad old days.

You can't help but remember that old quote that Einstein made.  ""I don't know what kind of weapons that World War 3 will be fought with, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones"".

She’s certain that this is the guy she’s been waiting for.
 The issue is that she doesn't know that he's actually a shapeshifter. The man asks her to go on a date to a fancy restaurant. When they're on the date the woman realizes that this man is perfect for her. Everything is going well, they are getting along and laughing and there is a charm in the air.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, people shouldn't worry too much about excessive screen time right now during the pandemic. For most people, it's a great way to keep up with others and stay informed of developments during the pandemic. Maybe previously screens served as an escape from reality but now it's quite the opposite. People use their screens as the way to stay connected to love ones and to the rest of the world during the pandemic. Our screen devices are able to help many people stay and feel connected in a time where isolation and separation can be extreme. 

At least for now, it seems logical to embrace the benefits of our digital devices. Instead of concerning ourselves with excessive screen time, we should focus our efforts on staying healthy, including self-care and plenty of rest. This may mean that we need to unplug from time to time, but screen time is only unhealthy when it takes away from that time when we reflect and care for ourselves. As long as we keep health and balance priorities in life, there should be no detrimental effects from excessive screen use. In conclusion, no, I do not think we should be worrying about a thing like screen use in the time that we are living.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is important to recognize and address both animal and human suffering. We must look closely not only at the suffering, but at the people that cause suffering. For example, the things that trigger someone to hurt a person are different than the things that would trigger someone to harm an animal. Humans use animals for labor, torture, and medical research. While with people, they usually suffer because of emotional reasons, revenge, etc. I noticed that in the real world, many people who abuse humans have been abused as well. So instead of focusing on if animal rights are not important as human rights, we should learn more about the violent people and ways to intervene.  For example, I know that if a child has been abused at home, he or she is most likely to physically hurt others when they grow up. Early intervention is key. Educating children about violence is another great way. Looking for early warning signs is important. The treatment of the home environment is key and can tell a lot about the future behaviors of someone. Maybe violence towards animals and humans is not so different, but I totally understand why people are more concerned about preventing human abuse. In conclusion, I strongly believe that animal abuse is a warning sign that someone will do the same to humans as well. It's not always the other way around.  No one should be criticized for wanting to help one more than the other. Help is help, and is always needed. ",23,7,8,0,8,13,8,5,0,8,0.0,0.34782608695652173,0.34782608695652173,0.5384615384615384

In my opinion, schools should absolutely provide free pads and tampons for several reasons.

People would be more interested in going to school
That stuff is expensive
1eople can't help getting periods

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, one of the the worst, and still the most common, is the hapless father figure in sitcoms.   The dad who is a bumbling idiot, who can't do anything right, and is constantly being made fun of by his family.  The dad, that despite this, still has a younger, attractive, intelligent wife.   This stereotype has been around almost since the advent of television, and certainly since the advent of sitcoms.  This is a stereotype that I think is still very much alive in today's sitcoms.  It is such a common trope that there is even a new sitcom that plays with the idea and makes fun of it.  For the most part it is harmless, but it is still a stereotype that I think is pretty bad.  I suppose the figure must come from the writers and creators of the shows, typically men, and there must be some kind of wish fulfillment somewhere in its ever present appearance.   Maybe it exists because of what people have been trained to expect, or it plays into the biases of the audience, or the person most likely to be picking what to watch.   I think it is a stereotype that is pretty bad, and I think it is one that should be retired.  In this day and age, and with the progress many people in society want to soo happen, you would anticipate the end of this character.  However, here and now, this fictional character makes me cringe every time.",15,4,7,0,4,9,4,5,1,3,0.0,0.4666666666666667,0.26666666666666666,0.5435540069686411

---

In my opinion, all the screen time for online schools, online work from home or remote work it going to have a very bad impact on us socially. Sooner or later people will become anti-social. People will forget how to deal with others in person. People will lose their patience. We will develop problems communicating with others due to the mostly the loss of personal connection with others.

We have seen this in the development of gaming for instance.  What seems like a long time ago, if you wanted to play a multiplayer game, you had multiple controllers, food, snacks, drinks, and your friends would come over to your house to play (or you would go to theirs). These friends were not complete strangers. Sure, there was fun loving jibbing each other sometimes, but no one felt like they were really under personal attack.

Today if you play a game online, you stay at home and connect your PC or console to the internet and join an online game. Gamers have become toxic to each other across because there is no longer a sense of personal connectedness or friendship at all. It's easy to call someone a loser when there is no consequences for said action.

The same thing will take place across screens for work and school as time goes by. People will not feel that sense of comradery at work anymore. Kids won't develop a social sense of friendship with kids outside the home anymore, and teachers won't feel as dedicated to their students or bosses to their employees.",20,6,11,0,3,3,3,0,1,2,0.0,0.55,0.15,0.5894428152492669

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, I prefer reading a book than listening to an audiobook. The main reason is that only by reading a book, can I understand how the story progresses and can I really get to know the character. A writer’s style might be very difficult to understand in an audiobook, but it becomes a lot easier to understand when reading. Also, I think that audiobooks are not worth the money: a book costs less than an audiobook. In addition, books never run out of batteries.  Think of an example, if I am at the beach with my family, an audiobook will be useless. However, if I have a book, I can stay with my family and still enjoy a good book. And, finally, reading is a different experience than listening to an audiobook.  A book changes my mood when I read it, whereas I barely feel a thing when listening to an audiobook. My mood can hardly be connected to just a voice without reading words in a book. Reading a book is fun because I can connect with the characters and the plot, which are very hard to achieve through listening.  However, listening to an audiobook is boring because it feels like the voice belongs to someone who is reading aloud to me.  Listening to an audiobook can still be beneficial because there is no need to strain one’s eyes.

An alarm went off in the house of the 92nd little pig's wife, where she was raising the 93rd little pig. She knew what it meant. ""Operation No Wolf"" had been a success. The wolf had been eliminated, and since he was the last of his line, there would be no more wolves to harass little pigs in the future. This meant that she could now raise her little pig in peace.

So, that's what she did. She raised the little pig to be thoughtful, and curious, and without wolves to worry about, he became a very intelligent, and curious, and considerate little pig. When he was 18, he decided to go to college, and he studied hard, and he graduated with honors. After that, he attended Yale Medical School, and he became a doctor.

The US government appointed a young man named Brad Armstrong to lead this team. Armstrong had a great experience in the world of motorcycle racing and was seen by officials as the perfect man to lead this team. He was a man that people could look up to in times of crisis and follow their lead. Brad begins to examine the successes of other countries and what the US would have to do in order to catch up. To get accurate information they would need to infiltrate the foreign governments and steal their secrets. Armstrong's job was to locate an agency deep enough in the government to do these espionage missions. 

     His team was a rag-tag group of misfits from other espionage missions in the past. Each member is unique in their own way, but together they make a powerful force that can take on any force. The team consisted of a biker named Crunch, an expert marksman named Bullet, and a male nurse named Poison. All of them were hand-picked by Armstrong and each member had a specialty they could contribute to the team.  After their initial briefing, the team became familiar with each other and were ready for the mission. The US government had placed them undercover and in the same building as the foreign agency, they would be stealing information from. They were prepared for anything and would steal the information directly from the UN which houses information on all countries. 
The team was able to successfully infiltrate the United Nations and steal all the files they needed.
 The team meets back at the safehouse and gets congratulated by the president. They were told they did an amazing job and were now able to use this information to get the United States back into the global scene.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screens are a clear and present danger in our lives. Despite this, screen use remains a necessary component of daily life. Because of this, we must remain more vigilant now than ever before about the potential negative impacts that it has on our daily lives. 

During the pandemic, the excessive screen use is resulting in lasting harm to health of our vision. This increase in usage often the result of sharp increases rather than a slow transition and is therefore more detrimental in the impact it has on our vision. Blue light has been linked to decreased retinal activity and has shown a statistically significant increase of early onset blindness in senior citizens who have reported more than 10 hours of screen time each day. 

Physical dangers aside, there is also a concern about the content that is behind the screen. We live in a time when truth and lies are blended together for our online consumption. This sharing of misinformation during a time when it is most important to have the best information possible has been extremely damaging to society’s trust in our institutions. Any benefits gained are far outweighed by the risk to our relationships and to the stability of our society.

Despite all of this, screens use is not likely to change and we should therefore make sure to protect our eyesight as best we can. It would also benefit our choices by better understanding the dangers and risks attached with prolonged screen use. In many ways, screens are such an important part of life that their use should be an assumed and any risks mitigated. ",18,6,9,0,3,4,3,1,0,3,0.0,0.5,0.16666666666666666,0.5612535612535613

This means that the countries will not be able to travel outside of their borders, nor communicate with other nations. This was approved by many if not most of the nations of the world, and was backed up by countless experts who agreed that isolation was needed for the world to stabilize itself. With the approval of the world's leaders, the countries of the world entered isolation on the year 2101, remaining isolated from others until the year 2102.
Within the first year, all forms of communication were cut off, and the only way to communicate was through a network of satellites set up across
 nations in case of a severe emergency, that required the intervention of other countries to aid one another. However, the satellites were never utilized in the hundred of years of isolation. In fact, it appeared as if most countries were fine during isolation, able to recover economically and become stable as experts had predicted. There were no wars or conflicts, and the world continued to move on without major issues that would involve many nations around a singular issue. In fact, the only thing that seemed to really be a problem was that international trade was basically nonexistent. As per the rules of isolation, many countries were prohibited from trading with other countries goods and services. This proved problematic for some countries, but the lack of communication via satellites during the duration of the satellites suggested that those countries would find domestic means to satisfy their resource needs.
The year 2112 ceventually arrived, and communications between countries were re-established. However, it was soon discovered that there were major issues that had arisen in the absence of communication and trade throughout the world. Many of the third-world countries had been able to make due during the isolation, but the first-world countries had suffered from the lack of trade, in addition to other economic issues. These countries for whatever reason it may be did not chose to use the satellite communication during the period of isolation, out of pride and fear that the other countries would view them as vulnerable. This was proven to be a fatal mistake, as these countries were not prepared for the monumental challenges that they faced in the return of communication. Many of the countries that suffered from isolation ended up going into conflicts with one another, for resources and other material goods that it had lacked during the isolation. Trade battles and other economic struggles occurred between the biggest nations of the world, dragging the smaller countries into it causing them to suffer as well. It turns out that isolation was not the answer to the world's problems, and that the only way for nations to survive was continue to communicate and work with one another. During the period of isolation, no problems, no wars or conflicts, and no apparent struggles were reported around the world.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.  

Additionally, athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. There is widespread satisfaction for this program by all players.

If this same system were allowed in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to animals because we tend to regard animals as innocent and defenseless. Humans are capable of reasoning and rationalizing, as well as making decisions. They understand the things that are causing their suffering, and they are capable of changing their lives, actions, or environments in order to alleviate it. Animals, on the other hand, cannot mediate their suffering in this way. A suffering human can often escape the forces causing their pain, while a suffering animal stays in its environment and is incapable of finding relief, unless chance or death, or a concerned human, intervenes to bring them relief. We also tend to view humans as responsible for their own suffering, while animals are seen as non-volitional, innocent, and deserving of sympathy. In other words, a suffering human is often viewed as 'getting what they deserve', while a miserable animal is seen as pitiful and undeserving of their suffering.

To a certain extent, these things are true. Humans are different than animals, and have much greater capacity to reason and make decisions, and can often escape their circumstances, while animals cannot. To this extent, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude that we have a greater responsibility to animals than to humans, especially when the human whose welfare is at stake has a presumed obligation to see to their own preservation. In this sense, we are the shepherds of animals, while other humans are assumed to be their own shepherds.

So while the tendency is understandable, it overlooks certain things. Humans are animals, too, with greater capabilities than most, but still, subject to many of the same forces of nature as any other animal, and similar limits when it comes to their ability to change these circumstances. While it might be comforting to assume that humans can do something about the obstacles that they face, it is often the case that small, seemingly petty factors can combine to force humans into a corner that they cannot get out of. So, those who reserve their sympathy for animals might be well-advised to reconsider their priorities when it comes to the suffering of an individual, helpless human.

Because if a helpless animal is deserving of pity, and help, a helpless human, who is ultimately just another suffering animal,  is deserving of this, as well. It makes no sense to respond to the suffering of one animal, and ignore the suffering of another who is equally, if not more, worthy of empathy and help.",24,7,1,1,15,24,20,4,1,19,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.6666666666666666,0.4524714828897338

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, one the most stereotypical characters I've encountered have been in the form of the ""evil"" stepmother and stepsisters. They're always portrayed as mean, and cruel, usually to the point of being physically abusive, to a protagonist who is usually a young girl, and usually prettier than they are. This runs contrary to the many real life examples I've seen of stepmothers and stepsisters who are kind, loving, and supportive of their stepchildren. And along with that, in the examples of actual stepmothers who are cruel, they're as likely to be cruel to male stepchildren as female ones,  perhaps even more likely. 

Along with this stereotype, comes the stereotype of the put upon, beautiful, and kind heroine, who is usually a young girl, who is forced to work as a servant in her own home. She's always virtuous, and pure (and did I say beautiful?) and makes an honest effort to be a dutiful stepchild, while the stepmother and stepsisters are 100% cruel, and manipulative towards her father, who is usually a widower, and completely clueless as to what is going on in his own home.

This brings to mind a third stereotype, which comes in a package with the previous two - the ""bad dad."" In this case, the father is merely well meaning but incompetent, but often , he's just plain bad. He's either a drunk, or a gambler, or a womanizer, or all of the above. His parenting skills are nonexistent, and he's usually a complete moron to boot. If he's married, his wife divorces him. If he remarries, his new wife is either a saint forced to vainly attempt to reform him, or a monster who is cruel to his children. In no event does he ever fix all the problems he's caused, this is always left to his wife or children.

There are many other stereotyical characters I could mention, but I'd say the above three are some of the most noxious, because they are so common, and so often used, and usually occur in a package. An individual stereotyped character in a story can be tolerated, or forgiven, but it is the combination of all three that makes me cringe.

In my opinion, people tend to be more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than humans sometimes because, let's face it; humans can be downright mean and despicable. Its easy to feel sorry for a dog who just wants to be loved, but it can be much harder to feel compassion for a person if you are someone who has seen humans do cruel and unspeakable things to each other. I don't think this is wrong and it's in our nature to feel the way that we feel. 
I know that humans are suffering and I do think we should care about that. However, I think that we should care about the suffering of all living creatures and I don't think that caring for animals does anything to take away from caring for humans since it's common to care for both. So no, the amount of human suffering that exists does not make it wrong to focus on animal welfare. 
If a person has been harmed by another person a lot in his or her life then I can imagine how their trusted animal companion would be held in a higher regard than a person, who they know might actually hurt them. Some people wrongly think that many people are a threat because of thing they have experienced. For them to care more about animals isn't wrong. 
There are many explanations for why it's NOT wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer, but most importantly if people don't even care about animals, then who will?",16,7,7,0,2,7,2,5,2,0,0.0,0.4375,0.125,0.48118279569892475

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, there is nothing selfish about pursuing exciting and extreme sports, especially mountain climbing.   It is in keeping with the human spirit to seek what is exciting and what we hope will give us a sense of belonging and worth. And one way many seek this is by experiencing nature in its most wild setting, near the tops of the world's highest, most imposing mountains. It is a type of presence and joy that these activities bring that is not selfish in nature at all. In fact it makes you more connected to nature and everyone in it. 
As far as I am concerned, a true sport is any participation in which people are trying to push themselves ato see what the human body and mind are capable of. Mountain climbing and similar sports do just that. It is not an easy activity but produces a sense of self-worth when you do finally achieve the goal. And isn't growth what being alive is all about? It can't be selfish to achieve ones goals in any case. We all have different goals. It is in the difference of our goals and the striving that takes place to achieve them that keeps life interesting, balanced and exciting.

No sport can be too dangerous to call a sport if the person is knowingly and consciously choosing to accept the risk that comes along with the sport. It's a matter of personal choice. We take risks everyday, but it's up to us what risks are worthy. And many people think that extreme sports are a worthy risk and that is NOT selfish.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are self-discipline and how to use their time efficiently. When it comes to self-discipline, the ones that have it are typically successful in school and the ones that don't typically struggle.

Using time efficiently is a great skill that we first learn at school but it becomes even more important when we get a job. Lets say that we have a 5 page essay due in a week. There are some that will wait until last minute to start their essay. There are others that will create a prep sheet and plan out their time and their essay.

Once again, those who use their time efficiently will typically be successful in school and in life, and vice versa. Learning those things from a young age really helped me when it came to adulthood.

I had those skills and that helped me succeed in college. I had the self discipline to put my nose to the grindstone and work as hard as possible instead of doing fun things like going out to bars and parties. I understood that sacrificing during my college years would pay off when I finally got a job in my related field.

I think there are many things that are essential for students to learn besides these internal things that are somewhat integrated to our personality. Some people are just disciplined by nature. Some people aren't disciplined by nature. There are things that we learn from a young age such as how to spell, how to write, how to do addition and subtraction, etc that play a major role in our daily lives.

Think about where we would be without understanding the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Think about where we would be as a species if we didn't know how to do anything math related. We wouldn't even know if we were getting ripped off at the supermarket when we were given change. 

In general, school is different for everyone and as people we also value different things that we learn. For me personally, self discipline and using my time efficiently was the most important thing because they translated into success for my adult life. I understand however that that will be different for everyone. I just hope all students really take something from their school days and it leads to success in their adult life.

---

In my opinion, based on my personal experiences, the most important things students should learn in school are how to be independent, how to work with others, and how to be a good citizen. Those are the things I've learned, and without school, I shudder to think about how my life might have gone. Without school to assist me, I would have been a very different person, possibly fallen in with a bad crowd and turned to crime, and I might even have ended up in jail.

It's normal to think that schools are primarily responsible for teaching students how to read, write, and do math, but in the grand scheme of things, these skills are not the most important. In fact, they're relatively trivial by comparison to teaching students how to behave, and how to do the right thing. Besides, students can pick these skills up elsewhere. For instance, I learned to read and write from my parents,  and from books lying around the house. I learned math from one of my older brothers. I learned to write by making entries in my diary, and I even learned history by reading the 1962 Encyclopaedia Britannica.

So acquiring these skills was easy, but what about learning how to become a decent human being? My friends, and the kids in my neighborhood, were not always good role models. They tortured animals, they stole things, they vandalized property, and they even broke into houses. Though one of them taught me how to do math, they were not appropriate moral examples. My parents were not always good role models either. They drank, they smoked, they fought, and they even used drugs. Eventually they divorced, and my mother moved away. Meanwhile, the teachers and kids in school kept me on the straight and narrow, and they taught me how to be a good person. If I stepped out of line, they punished me, and they made me feel bad about myself until I acquired a sense of shame over doing the wrong thing, and a desperate desire to do the right thing. 

I think it's safe to say if not for school, I might have been a bad kid, and ended up a bad adult, too. Adults who can read or do math are a dime a dozen, but adults who can do the right thing are precious. Our schools owe it to our youth, and to our society, to teach our children how to be good people, and they should be held accountable if they fail to do so.",27,6,6,1,14,30,20,10,0,20,0.037037037037037035,0.2222222222222222,0.5555555555555556,0.46296296296296297

""No, of course not!"" Caleb said with a shaky voice. He did his best not to spit his coffee out after seeing the trail of zeros following a six. He wished that his son did not notice. ""I'm just going to set that on a different shelf."" He choked.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. I think it is good that there are people who are concerned about animal welfare. Not everyone considers themselves to be an animal lover, and even some animal lovers don't have the time or resources to help animals. 
I think it is important to help humans as well as animals.
 I think it is more engrained in our culture to help other people above all else. Helping animals is not as common, and people who do help animals are often seen as strange. The population of volunteers at animal organizations is small. Furthermore, there are many people who don't want to help animals because they believe that animals are not as important as humans. They are lacking in resources and labor. They need more help than anyone.  In conclusion, I think it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are portrayed as being stupid, lazy, or just plain evil. I see this a lot with the Black population, and I am getting tired of it. Maybe I am seeing things inaccurately, but it is annoying show after show and movie after movie to see Black people portrayed in the drug dealer role. Portrayed as living in areas of poverty and high crime, and being in a character that seems to lack education and intelligence. I don't know if this is true or not, but it is what I see. 
I have seen this with the Hispanic population as well.
 How many movies come out that are talking about cartels and how they are running the Hispanic neighborhoods? When these stereotypes are perpetuated in Hollywood, they are perceived as being real in everyday life. You can only see something so many times before you start to believe it must be true. Hollywood and studios need to take a real look at the movies they are producing. Maybe it's time to tell writers of these type of stories that enough is enough. I personally don't ever need to see another movie about inner city gangs killing each other or kidnapping innocent people. These things happen, but they happen with groups of white people, as well.  

Black and Hispanic people have normal everyday lives the same as the majority white population. Telling stories of the struggle for better education or getting the job they deserve may be something people would appreciate more. Let's begin to tell the situation as it is. That because of prevalent racism and prejudice in this country, minorities don't have the same opportunities. That doesn't mean they are all gang bangers, drug dealers, or low life thugs. They are citizens and humans trying to live like everyone else. It is offensive to different cultures and races, and quite frankly my intelligence, when stereotypes are allowed to be portrayed in the media time after time. 

Hollywood thrives on making money and if something is working for them they will continue to produce it. I guess the movies with negative stereotypes of minorities must be money makers. What if they weren't any longer? Would that cause the writers to think outside the box and see the world as it really is and not as it has been in their skewed minds.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, a democratic society should refrain from imposing any kind of duty on its citizens unless absolutely needed. So, people do have a duty to support themselves, care for themselves and their family, and refrain from harming others or breaking the law, since those things are necessary for a society to function. Following the news, however, is not, and should not be used as a measure of good or bad citizenship.

The question then becomes, is it even useful, or desirable to follow it? I think it is useful, but not for the reasons most people do. It is needed on a local level, to know what is going on in your community, and to be able to participate in local issues, and to respond in case of local emergencies. On a national level, it is needed to know what is going on in your country that might directly affect you, like changes in the law, or larger natural disasters, or massive economic shifts, so that you can respond appropriately. However, exploring political or social issues beyond this, or following the news for entertainment, is not useful, and can even be harmful.

The reasons for this are myriad. First of all, the news is not objective, and is often deliberately misleading. If a citizen wanted to know what was going on on a global level, it's not like they could just turn on the news and get a clear, unbiased picture of what is happening, so such a thing might not be practically attainable. That being the case, following the news can suck up a lot of time, and time is a valuable resource, that might be better devoted to meeting one's actual obligations. The news can also be very upsetting, and can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress. It could be said that being a good citizen might be better served, by not following the news, and causing oneself stress, and wasting time, and that a good citizen should instead expend their effort on focusing on their own life, and the lives of those they are responsible for.

I'd say being well informed is a nice idea, and a good goal to strive for, but that it is not a duty, and that it is not something that should be used to judge a person's status as a citizen, but instead it is a personal choice, and a personal goal, that could be considered a luxury, pursued by and possibly attainable only by those citizens who have the time, money, and energy to do so, in a responsible manner.",21,6,2,1,12,26,21,5,1,20,0.047619047619047616,0.09523809523809523,0.6190476190476191,0.448207171314741

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 

It took a lot of scientists and people with old wisdom to unlock this hidden power and the secrets behind it. They figured out that while yes, the mana is spread very thinly, if people work together they can channel their mana power together, creating an amount large enough to allow someone to wield it and its incredible power. 
The Mana-users are called ""Mana-Senshi"", which literally translates to ""Mana Warrior"".
 These warriors were chosen by a council of world leaders to wield the mana and use it against the alien invaders. Once they were selected, getting them their mana was simple; regular citizens from different areas would go to what was called a ""Mana Dispensary"" and unload their mana in some solution in a vial, which was combined with other vials until there was a canister large enough to administer to a Warrior through IV. The canister was then taken to the Warrior, who would then be infused with the mana. After being infused, the Warrior would go to a rigorous training camp to learn how to weld their new power along with the other elected Warriors. they were taught by some old sages who knew the ins and outs of mana and how it worked. 

At first, the regular citizens were apprehensive to go to these facilities and get their mana withdrawn from them. Up until today, no one even knew they had this kind of power flowing through them. People also did not trust the government and what they were being told. There were many protests and riots in the streets, but the government was able to quell them by promising that the Warriors would be used for good and it the only hope to fight the aliens. It wasn't until an attack by the aliens that killed thousands of humans happened that people became more accepting of the idea of unloading their mana. 

The warriors would learn how to cast powerful and ancient spells at their training camp that would be able to kill the aliens with relative ease. Once the warriors began to be dispersed around the world to fight the threat, the tides began to turn in the humans' favor. They stood no chance against the power of the Warriors. 

After a few hard fought years, the aliens were totally driven off of the planet and the human race was saved. the Warriors around the world were hailed as heroes, and most of them returned their mana to the planet itself, which restored some of nature the aliens destroyed. Unfortunately. not everyone was willing to give up their mana.

During this time, the Soviet Union conquered the world, enslaving most of humanity and forcing them to work in slave camps. Only a few cities remain free, and the United States sets out to liberate these slaves. The single-player campaign is centered around this objective, and the player will have to fight his way through numerous levels (most of which are on-rails) while playing as the protagonists of various missions.ut of Exile makes use of the standard FPS control scheme, namely the WASD keys for movement and mouse aiming; however, players can choose
 between a first-person view and a third-person view, although the third-person one is only available while using some weapons. The game also makes use of an auto-aim function and a cover system, which is activated by pressing the Tab key. Like Gears of War, the player can also perform rolls by double-tapping either forward or backward direction. The gameplay can be described as something in the old Zelda theme. Not as straightforward but there are a lot of side jobs.There are plenty of ammo and health pickups scattered around the levels, but some areas have no ammo at all, usually in order to make players think about how they want to proceed through the level, although it's not always clear how much to conserve and how much to use. In general, Out of Exile is a well-balanced game, and it's not too difficult to complete even on the hardest difficulty settings.The game is divided into three main campaigns, each one having its own set of levels. Although most of the levels are on-rails and do not allow free roaming around, there are some notable exceptions, one being a mission in which the player controls a tank and the other being a mission which takes place in an abandoned mine. The game is not too hard nor too easy , but most of the players playing it will find great value in their money as it's something really different than everything else on the market.

He tells you that there is a giant book of files about all of the things that have been hidden from the public. 

He tells you that he wants you to release those files to the public. You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. 

You think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.

Unbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was no answer. The phone was disconnected.

My friend Ed's mug was nowhere near as high as mine, but he informed me that day that his mug had changed too. It was happening all over the world. 
n this day, the rankings were fappearingaon all #1 Dad mugs nd everyone could see how each Dad ranked.
 I felt pretty bad about my mug, which i think was in the 600,000s. I had to see what I could do . I thought a lot about what I could do to get a better ranking, but it wasn't easy.
 My three kids deserved a good dad so I made a plan to improve it over the next week. The next day, I spent time with my kids doing fun things. I started the day by taking them out to breakfast. Then we went to the park and played frisbee. I helped with their homework after school that week too. They really seemed to like their attentive new dad. After a week I checked my mug, and it had changed. It was still not nearly as high as I wanted it to be, but it had moved up to the 50,000s. This, to me, was a BIG difference. I called Ed to share the news with him. Funny enough he had a similar story. It seems that everyone in the world who had one of these mugs was going through a similar experience and trying to be a better dad. There was even a story about it on the news.

 Fatal ones. And they were very unpleasant.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has definitely improved the dating scene. There's no more blind dates that go horribly wrong. You can now sit home and have a glass of wine while looking through profiles. It takes out a lot of the stress involved. It also makes it much easier to find a partner for certain kinks or fetishes. Not everyone is looking just for love. Some people are looking for something very specific and you'd never be able to find that without using a website or an app. If you look at it that way, it's bringing people together who would otherwise never have met. 

As far as technology as a whole, it can be a mix of good and bad when it comes to dating. Once you are in a relationship then technology can start to drive you apart. People can become obsessed with their phone or other device to the point that you feel like your partner is ignoring you for the device. This is an issue when people use technology to find love but then don't ever disconnect from it. People need to learn that there is too much of a good thing. Find what you need and then get out with technology. You already found love so what else is in your phone that is more important?

Technology is perfect to meet someone new. It will help you find that special person no matter what you are looking for. However you need to know when to cut back on technology. When you are in a relationship, you need to find your love for each other and not let technology get in the way. So find that person online and then cut off your need for such technology right after. Just enjoy what you have found and the more simple pleasures of life together. That's how you make love last. ",30,9,17,0,4,14,4,10,0,4,0.0,0.5666666666666667,0.13333333333333333,0.5157068062827225
754,6d0dc9355f9c4e0aa729c19733f3e3fd.jsonl,"What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypes are the ones that are used to make a character seem less than human. For instance, the idea that a person who is gay, or a person of color, or a woman, or an immigrant, or a person with disabilities is less of a person than someone who is straight, white, male, native-born and able-bodied.  Well known examples of this include the portrayal of the Native American as a savage, the portrayal of African Americans as lazy and stupid, the portrayal of women as weak and subservient to men. Each of these examples is offensive because it dehumanizes a group of people.  So, in the sense that I'm a person with high moral standards about how to treat my fellow humans, I view all of these as 'cringe worthy.'

The question of whether I would avoid reading a book or watching a movie because of a stereotyped portrayal, is a more difficult one. Is it possible for a work to be so well written that I can overlook the offensive portrayal? I find it hard to believe that I could ever do that, but I suppose it's possible. I think the problem is that I would have to be so caught up in the story that I wouldn't constantly notice the offensive portrayal.  Alternatively, the offensive portrayal could be a small enough part of the overall work that I could overlook it. In either of these cases, the stereotype wouldn't be enough to make me stop reading or watching.

However, I find this unlikely. For the most part, a work that is offensive in this way is offensive because the author or director is trying to be offensive. So, the offensive portrayal is likely to be a large part of the work, or at least a large part of the author's or director's intent, and if the same stereotype doesn't occur constantly, other offensive stereotypes will. Also, the use of stereotypes suggests a lack of creativity on the part of the author or director. So, it's unlikely that the rest of the work will be so well written that the stereotype would be particularly easy to overlook.

We live in a world where the use of stereotypes is so common that it's hard to avoid them. However, we also live in an era where people are becoming more aware of the harm that stereotypes cause. In this day and age, it's not so easy to write off stereotypes as mere lazy writing. It makes more sense to view them as a conscious choice to dehumanize people. Perhaps rather than merely avoiding these works, we should be calling them out for what they are, and calling on the creators to cease using them, and treat people with the respect that they deserve.",25,4,3,1,17,30,24,6,0,24,0.04,0.12,0.72,0.42996108949416345

I turned to the version of myself sitting right next to me and I asked what was going on. That version explained that we all sit here and watch how the next version performs in life and we all evaluate it. It is fun and we get to sometimes vote on what the next version will do. It makes for an interactive experience. Curious about this, I ask why I didn't feel like that happened when I was living the life. The version of myself explained that I did experience that, but when I was living it these moments just felt like epiphanies to me. This explanation made sense to me. 

I looked around the theater and while everyone had the same face as me, they were all dressed in their era appropriate clothing. There was a huge variety of people in the theater. The youngest must have been in their early 40's or so and the oldest were over 200.  veryone began to notice me and I was introduced to the people next to me.
 Everyone greeted me happily and said that they were proud of what they viewed in my movie. I was at first creeped out, but then realized that that is what we do here and everyone here saw my entire life. I told them that they were all right, and I was proud of it too. 

I asked my neighbor if we sit here for all eternity and he explained that no, we do not. We watch the movie and sometimes we get the chance to hop into the next life if our number is picked in the raffle. He told me not to worry because time passes by really quickly in this theater. My neighbor explained that we all have a number on our back and he said that most people pick a number to represent them in their next life. I looked at my own back and saw my number. I asked my neighbor how long he's been in the theater and he said he didn't know. There was no concept of time here and he's just happy to sit back and enjoy the movie.

I looked at the screen, which was still black and asked when the movie was going to start. He told me that the overlords are still picking a candidate to live the movie but it shouldn't be much longer. I was actually excited to see my next life, the whole concept seemed fascinating to me.

A few moment later, a big spotlight appears in the sky and beamed at a seat a few rows ahead of me. A version of me dressed in clothing from seemingly the 12 century was sitting down and he got excited. His number was chosen.   The other versions in the theater began to cheer him on and he was very happy. 

This version began to float in the air and in a flash, he disappeared into a ball of light that hurdled towards the screen. The screen lit up in a flash and a timer appeared. It was counting down from 30 seconds and we could hear sounds. It sounded like a hospital room, and a distant voice of a doctor could be heard.

I saw the shaped charges you used on the 91st pig's steel reinforced concrete house, and that's not gonna cut it with mine."" The wolf was like, ""Whatever, dude. I'm tired of this game anyway, you build the craziest most reinforced house you like, because I'm not huffing, or puffing, or shooting. or dynamiting, or anything else to try to get in there."" Then, the wolf went off to the forest to live a normal wolf life, he joined a pack, and became a normal wolf. He met a lady wolf, they had cubs, and ate deer, and rabbits, and it was a very happy, normal wolf life.

Meanwhile, the pig sat around his depleted uranium house, and worried. He was like, ""What if the wolf hadn't given up?"" He was constantly waiting for the attack which never came. He lived in fear for seven years. Over those seven years, he ate his food without savoring it, he never laughed, he had no friends or family. He searched his house for hidden ways in, and when he couldn't find any, he searched for hidden ways out. That was a bust. He checked the yard for signs of the wolf, he installed motion sensing cameras around his house, he bought a wolf-call for the phone. He did constant Google searches related to home security, and incidentally found out that depleted uranium was a little dangerous, and known to raise the incidence of cancer in human tank operators.

He told himself that that didn't apply to pigs, and in any event, it was worth it to be wolf-free. So, he sat, and he waited, and he ate. He got fat as a pig, which in this case, him already being fat as a pig, meant he was as fat as a pig that had gotten fatter than a normal pig. In other words, as fat as two pigs. After seven years of this, he realized he was slowly killing himself, and  wasting his life, and he decided he would leave home for the first time in seven years to see what was going on outside.

He left his depleted uranium home, and ventured out to the forest, where he saw the normal wolf pack which had been living there, completely oblivious to his existence. He spoke to the wolf. ""Hey, you look pretty happy, I guess not eating me was a pretty good deal after all?"" The wolf was silent, because now he was a normal wolf who couldn't talk.

The pig continued ""So, would it be okay if I moved out here, and lived a normal life you like you have?"" The wolf moved his head a bit, which the pig took as an assent, and the pig began rooting among the shrubs for stuff to eat.

The wolf pack hesitated for a moment, surprised by this strange creature that talked, and seemed to have no fear of them. After that moment, of course, they fell on him and tore him to pieces. That's what wolves do, after all.",36,6,15,0,15,19,16,3,0,16,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.4166666666666667,0.43414634146341463

I choose a private box seat. 
The reason I choose a private box seat is because I want to be able to see everything that is going on.
 I want to be able to see the people, the places, and the things that I will be doing in my next life. I am very excited to see how this goes.  The lights start to dim as the film begins to play. I am sitting on the edge of my seat. The film is about a little girl who is about to be born. She is a very special little girl. It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. 
As the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children.
 She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. 

The lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. ""It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends."" 
The lights dim again and the film resumes.
 The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. She asks, ""What is the meaning of life?"" She writes down the question in her book. 
The lights come on again.

The stranger notices the danger. He says, ""I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help you."" That seems unlikely to me. I tell him I'm not interested in his help. He goes away and never comes back.

He had a fulfilling job, a stable family, and he had plenty of money and time to pursue his hobbies and interests. It would appear that nothing too major would affect him in his life, but that was not the case. For John experienced the oddest event one day, one that would bring about adversity in his life.

His children had gifted him a mug last Father's day, which he cherished and used every day for his morning tea. He liked to drink it to relax before work, and his children were happy whenever they saw him use the mug they bought for him. However, one day they woke up and looked at him funny while he was drinking his tea.
""You get a new mug Dad?"" asked his daughter, who was at the time only four years old.
 Puzzled, John replied no. For it was the same mug he drank from every day since last Father's day, a step-up from the plain ceramic mug he used to drink tea from.

Turning the mug around, he noted that his children were indeed correct, the mug he held did not say #1 Dad. In fact it said, #54 Dad. Thinking it was an elaborate prank from his family, John asked his children where his old mug was. They all shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know. Asking his wife who was heading to work, she seemed as confused as he was regarding the mug, and denied any involvement in the different appearance of the mug.

In any case, John placed the mug in the sink, and would come back to clean it later. He dropped off his kids at school, and returned back home to get to work. Work went on as normal, but when he went to get his mug from the sink he noticed something bizarre. The mug he placed in the sink now said #50 Dad. It dropped down by 4 numbers, he was sure of it. Growing more confused, he thought someone had broken into his house, but he had found no signs of forced entry, and his mug was in the same place he had set it down. Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.

However, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.

The following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before.

But the wolf couldn't blow it down, because depleted uranium is one of the most dense elements in the known universe!
 So he had to come up with a new plan. He disguised himself as a health inspector, and he walked up to the house and just stood there for a while. Then, he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig! It's the health department!"" 
he 92nd little pig recognized his voice, so he said, ""No thanks, wolf.
 I'm healthy as a pig!"" 

The wolf said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong address."" And he walked away. But the wolf knew that the little pig would go to visit his neighbor, so he waited outside the next house. And as soon as the 92nd little pig walked out, he snuck up and put a bag over his head and took him away. 

he wolf put the 92nd little pig in a big pot and started to heat the water.
 But the 92nd little pig was smart. He managed to squirm his way to the edge of the pot, and when he did, he grabbed a nearby radio antenna and pulled it out. The antenna was attached to the city's radio station, and when he pulled it out, all of the city's residents could hear him screaming for help!
So the people of the city stormed the wolf's house and rescued the 92nd little pig.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

When the aliens invaded over 50 years ago, it caught humanity by surprise. We used to think that we were alone in this vast universe, but we were sorely mistaken. As magical beings, humanity had always had a firm grasp on on our magical powers. As our world grew, our magical powers began to wither away. The mana pool, where humanity gained its magical powers from, was not sufficient enough to sustain the population on our planet as it grew beyond 7 billion. Our government had tried for years to limit the birth of children in order to maintain our magical powers to a certain degree, but progress was too slow. Most of our magical powers were mere shadows of what they used to be. The supply of mana could not power our magical ambitions. As morbid as it sounds, some humans saw the alien invasion as an opportunity to start over, a clean slate. The alien invaders enslaved humanity and killed countless others on their conquest of our planet. As the human population decreased, the mana pool began to have a greater effect on our powers once more. The remaining humans began to band together in small communities, and used their powers for the betterment of humanity. The betterment of humanity meant fighting against our alien masters, taking back our planet. Our small communities learned to combine our powers and mana, to conjure devastating powers. Our powers are evolving in ways we never thought possible. We had to plan our counter attack carefully because we could not risk getting discovered, or worse, killed. We had to come up with a way for us to wipe out the aliens quickly and quietly. The aliens had learned to harness mana and had hoarded a large supply of it in their main base of operations. If we could destroy their main supply of mana, we could cripple their operations. We had been successful in planting a mole within their alien ranks, which gave us a window into their operations. We knew the best time to attack is when they are at their weakest, in the middle of a new moon. The new moon weakened their bodies to a point of hibernation, which was the perfect window of attack. We had to strike now, before they were fully prepared for the new moon. On the dawn of the new moon, our mole and a few of our soldiers planted an explosive, magic bomb at the alien mana source. They managed to escape before the explosion. The explosion was loud and bright. The aliens were weak and feeble without their source of mana. We began our attack by sending in our soldiers, wiping out the aliens quickly. Our soldiers were armed with magic guns, which harnessed our newly found powers. The fighting progressed throughout the night, with humanity gaining more and more victories. The aliens became desperate and began to use their most powerful weapons. The weapons were no match for our magical powers, proving to have no effect on us. Our soldiers were able to subdue the remaining aliens with ease. By morning, the alien camps had been wiped out entirely and we regained our foothold on our planet.  hen we finally had control of our planet, the government decided to divide it up into small communities.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

Young men generally take risks. The reasons for this are unclear. Some argue that the human brain is not fully formed until the late twenties. Whatever the reason, soldiers who willingly risk death are almost always young men. The same is true for extreme mountain climbers.
It is a well-known fact that the majority of deaths among professional rock climbers occur in the twenties, the prime of their lives.

It is generally thought that men crave risk, even foolishly so, while women acknowledge risks much more realistically.
 Although that may be an oversimplification, there is clearly an underlying difference between the way men and women deal with risk.

Given these facts, would society condone risk-taking by young males by allowing extreme sports? The fact is, society already condone risk-taking by young males by recruiting them for the armed services. So there is less of a moral issue here than one might at first think.
TAll sports have an element of risk, and injuries are common. More than a few men have even died as a result of sports injuries. here is a point, however, where the sheer level of risk involved begins to feel too high.
 Perhaps those who participate in extreme sports may indeed be pushing that point, but the important fact is that young men will court the same level of risk whether people will pay to watch or not. It is their nature. So we who watch extreme sports do not really alter the equation, we just enjoy what they do.

he fact is, men acanchoose for themselves whether they take on risk.
 And spectators can choose for themselves whether to watch it. There may be moral issues here, but none of them align with the differences between extreme sports and other activities.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely get paid and thinking otherwise is ridiculous. Very simply put, the athletes make the universities an insane amount of money and never see a dollar of it.

The argument that they are getting a scholarship which is a payment is a ridiculous one to me. Sure they are getting a scholarship. They also are working much harder than the typical student.

Student athletes are basically being a full time student and a full time athlete at the same time. Thankfully, a bill was just passed that allows students to make money off of their name and their likeness.

I would be willing to bet than an athlete like Zion Williamson made Duke at least 20 times the amount that his scholarship was. The student athletes have simply been exploited by colleges in the past, and the only people who see no issues with that are the universities themselves.

The entire student athletes getting a scholarship thing is a scam. It's just a scam that the universities and the top 1%  push because it helps make them money.

Paying student athletes would not destroy college sports. Would it have an effect on the sports economy? Sure. Instead of the universities and networks keeping 100% of the profits and getting rich off of the student athletes, they'll have to give them their fair share.

Anyone who disagrees with students not getting paid for sports simply wants to exploit them. There is no reason why a student should be risking injury before they go pro for a university for free. I don't want to hear the scholarship excuse. Students could have a full ride for academics. Then what happens to those students?

They get a full ride for academics and them playing sports gets them nothing extra? Maybe a free textbook or free lunches from the school cafeteria?

We have finally figured out that this scam has been going on for too long and that is why the lawmakers made a change. The exploitation of these 18-22 year old men and women is disgusting. I'm extremely happy that it is changing.

There have been so many student athletes in the past that have been used by their university. If people ever saw the amount of money that Alabama makes from their football program, their jaws would drop. That goes the same for Duke and North Carolina for basketball. That goes for basically all of the SEC and ACC teams in college football.

There is enough money being made off of the college athletes to spread the wealth. I do think there should be a cap on it and/or there should be a GPA to maintain in order to get their payments. If they fall below a 2.0 GPA for example they get fined or something along those lines to teach them the consequences of slacking off.

Most college athletes won't go pro so they still need to make sure their academics are a priority. As long as their grades are in good standing, they should get their payments. We have had enough of students being exploited by the people in power. That exploitation is now dead and students will get the money that they rightfully deserve.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we should keep up with what's going on in the world.   We should always be informed and current on what is happening because if something big happens we should know how it affects us and our community. It is our responsibility as citizens to stay informed.  
Some people might not engage with current events because they don't have time , but that is their choice. I have heard many times, if you're not informed, then you don't have a voice.  I think staying informed does matter. In everyday life, it might be overwhelming to try to take on news or any new information. But there might come a time when there's a sudden big change or change in events that directly affects you. If that should happen, you might be faced with tough decisions that have to be made fast. At that point, it will be too late to do all the research to help you determine the best action and who to trust.   I personally think we should be aware and follow current events. Some people find the news to be depressing because they always cover death and disaster. But there are many news sources available these days that cover a variety of topics.  This includes sports, entertainment, trends and even recipes. It is best to follow your intuition and find some things to check regularly.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals are not able to take care of themselves. We have a tendency to want to protect them. They are innocent in our eyes and they just want to be loved and cared for. They don't judge us and they tend to approach us when a stranger would not. They are loyal and they love us unconditionally. I feel like we've been hurt by at least one person in our life so we are more standoffish around them. With animals most of us have not had a bad experience so we're more likely to respond in a favorable way towards them. 

People also disappoint us. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they hurt us. These are things that we realize from a young age. I feel that on a more instinctive nature that we're more likely to care about an animal being harmed than a human for those reasons. 

I feel probably that people who haven't had pets may be more likely to feel empathetic towards a human than an animal though. They may not realize how kind and loving animals can be. They may not realize that animals are just as capable of feeling pain and suffering as humans. That could be a factor in how people respond to whether they feel more sympathy for a person or an animals. 

In general I believe people respond to the innocence of animals which is why they may feel more sympathy for them. I'm one of those people so I can relate. I wish more people would want to help animals as they need our help. I am happy though that there are people who consider them just as important as humans.

When I was 28 and the government gave all the young people the drug I was envious at first. But as I got much older, that greatly changed. I saw all the young people making foolish decisions. It seemed that in addition to not aging, the young people never mentally matured either. All the things that I'd learned over the years—in school, in life, in self-discovery—were being ignored. It seemed that the ""young"" people never learned much of anything. 
Little did I know that it was more than just ignorance.
 The young ones were starting to act strangely, their behavior more erratic than it was before they got the drug. You could never seem to predict what one of them would do. They never learned from their mistakes and they had no self-control. And as the older generation got older and older, they had no interest in showing care or giving back to the older community. We were simply abandoned. Even the people in government were all the young ones as we in the ""Lost Generation"" had grown too old for the government positions. It was a sad situation in deed. 
One day, I decided to come up with a plan. I would become a doctor and give the old people immortality too. So I worked and worked and created a drug that would help the older people. The drug made us all 35 again, and we didn't age either. And it was a success. Before long, the ones who were considered ""lost"" were getting elected for positions in government and we were able to turn it all around. We still had the young immature people who would never recover from the effects that what we now call ""stupid pills"" had on them. But they had us to take care of them and the Earth from then on.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, this argument is a sound base, but is only half of the picture. I think college athletes should be paid - they are essentially working for their schools, and should be compensated as other student workers are. 
TThat said, te argument that paying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni is a valid one.
 Or rather, that it could hurt students, schools, etc. It doesn't have to. It would be complicated, but rules, limits, and regulations could be developed to prevent or solve most of the issues that would arise from paying student athletes.

It could be argued that it is inherently unfair - that some sports are more popular than others, and that some schools have more money than others. Which is true. But some schools already have more money than others, better teams than others, and have other advantages. And the same with students - some are just better athletes and are highly courted already.

It seems unfair to take advantage of students talents and not compensate them. Yes, certain athletes in popular sports will make more money, and certain schools will be more desirable than others. But tht is post-school life anyway - graduates with degrees from ""better""  schools have an easier time finding better, higher paying jobs, and student athletes from schools with strong programs are more likely to go on to be professional athletes. 

In fact, allowing college athletes to be paid, with oversight and a number of regulations, might help cut down on the unofficial and rather shady system of perks that is now used, making the whole system much more transparent and accountable. More attention would be paid to what students are actually receiving, and with caps might actually be fairer to all students. 

So, I believe there are a number of issues with paying student athletes, but there are also a lot of issues with the current system. Paying athletes like any other employee would allow a more fair system that could be regulated and monitored, and withg teh right rules could benefit everyone.",25,9,14,0,2,7,2,5,1,1,0.0,0.56,0.08,0.47347740667976423

The dads are all very confused and upset.
 It's insulting to have to look at a Worst Dad mug. They all want to know what is going on. They set up a meeting in town and nobody really knows what to say. They don't have any information on what actually happened. 
The dads are all very upset and angry.
 They all go home and turn on the TV. When the TV is turned on there is a message from an alien. He explains that they were doing a science experiment on his home planet. Just switching out one simple word caused all of the dads in town's personalities to change. All over a stupid little mug that they could have thrown in the garbage.

The dads went from being the upbeat, happy and helpful men to being angry and furious all over the word worst. The alien explains to them that they need to not let words have that kind of power. The entire point of the science project was to teach the humans a lesson. 

The lesson being that overreacting to something small can have bad consequences. The alien tells the dads to think about their wives and children. Did the dads even care about their feelings over this entire ordeal? Of course not. And those people should be the priority in a Dad's life. Not a mug.

Think about that next time a stressful event happens. Always prioritize what's actually important in life. The alien had done his job and the experiment was a success. The dad's had learned from him and were grateful.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is how to interact with other people. I think that this is the most important thing because it will help them in their future. If children can learn how to interact effectively with other people, they will be able to get along with them. 

They will be able to get along with their friends and their family. They will be able to get along with their teachers and their bosses. They will be able to get along with their coworkers. They will be able to get along with their neighbors. They will be able to get along with the people they meet. 

Most of life is dealing with other people. We have interactions with people every day, and during our formative years, if we learn to make the interactions smooth, we will have an easy life. If we don't, we will have a hard life. Think of most negative actions. Murder, war, divorce, famine-how many were caused by a breakdown in communication-how many problems could we solve with better communication and empathy? 
IBy far, te most important thing I have learned in school ,ior life in general, s how to communicate with other people.
 I had a teacher who genuinely cared about her students, and emphasized really listening to each other. She taught us how to listen to each other, and how to speak in a way that would be heard. She taught us how to be respectful of each other, and how to be honest with each other. She taught us how to be empathetic towards each other, and how to be kind to each other. She taught us how to be good friends, and how to be good family members.

ow has this knowledge affected my life?
 It has made my life much better. I have learned how to communicate with other people, and I have learned how to listen to them. I avoided many problems that would have happened, had I not truly been listening. I avoided hurting people by asking myself how they would feel.   I avoided many fights by listening to what the other person was saying, and trying to understand their point of view. 

This empathetic perspective, and ability to communicate with others has served me well. I have a good job, and I am happy.  I have good friends, and I have a good family. I have a good life, and I owe it to my ability to communicate with other people.

As long as I am able to communicate with others, I will have a good life in the future. These skills are the most important thing I learned in school,  and are key to my success in life. ",36,6,10,2,18,28,21,7,2,19,0.05555555555555555,0.2777777777777778,0.5555555555555556,0.3507751937984496

In my opinion, the stereotypical dumb blonde character makes me cringe. I think this character has been over used and is demoralizing to women. I have seen this character in many movies and television shows. I think it cheapens the show and is not at all realistic. If I see the ""dumb blonde"" in a show, it makes me less likely to want to watch it. 

I find this stereotype is not at all realistic and is really just another way to put women down. I think it is important to have strong female characters in movies and television shows. The stereotype of dumb blondes and women staying home to take care of a family and home is one that should be done away with. Times have changed. Women can be strong, independent and intelligent. This is what television shows should be portraying now. How are we going to teach children that women can do whatever they set their mind to if television shows are constantly portraying them in a negative light? 

The dumb blonde character is often also portrayed as sexy. This is another stereotype that I find offensive. Do we still have to use a pretty woman or sex to get people to watch a show? I think that television shows and movies should be more about the story line than what the characters look like. Times have changed and I think it is time to move past many stereotypes. We are supposed to be accepting of everyone and these stereotypes are just putting people down. There are many stereoptypes that we should be getting rid of but I would be happy if they started with eliminating the dumb blonde.

In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch. It oddly was very highly praised when it came out which shows how people must view gay people.C
Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like. 

So there's times stereotypes make me cringe and even angry. I try not to let it bother me. But I'm seeing less of it in general. I just feel that everyone should be shown as a wide range of people. Every race or group has people who are strong or weak or tough or feminine. There's so much variation. You just don't want to focus on one or a very limited amount.

One day, she meets a man who seems different from the rest. There were none of the early red flags that had plagued each of her other failed relationships. It was a bittersweet feeling though, because despite the fact that the others didn't work out, there had been something about the guys that she just felt an intense connection to. She was a little sad that she would never see them again, but she was also excited about the prospect of a new relationship.

There was that feeling upon first meeting him not so much that she knew him before, but that she was supposed to know him. It was still exciting in the way that new relationships are, but without the adrenaline rush of falling into the unknown.
They dated for a while, and she began to feel like she was falling in love.
 Until one night over a take out dinner and a movie he asked her about her past relationships. She could lie and act like they had all been horrible, but it had always been her policy to be honest and mature. She loathed the way that some would throw others under the bus just to make themselves look better in the relationship.
She told him about the guys she had dated, and how she had felt an intense connection to them.
 She was worried that she might be going overboard by telling him about the good points of each. But she couldn't help the warmth that crept into her voice when she recounted her time with them. She looked down at her wineglass while she told him about each one. She was afraid to see his expression and was sure he did not have a pleasant one. But she was helpless to stop. It was as if she was compelled to keep telling him about the others and unable to tell him anything but the truth.
When she was finished, she looked up at him.
 For a moment she was stunned. He was not sitting there with a look of disgust on his face. Instead he was gently smiling and looking at her like she was the most precious being on earth. He gently stroked the side of her face and told her how special she was. After a tender kiss he leaned back and looked at her intently.

Then he told her it was that special quality that made him unable to give up on her. At first she was confused.  But then he explained to her that all of the men had been him. Every good part of the previous men were still there. But with each time he failed with her, he learned what he had done wrong and kept trying. And now finally he was literally her perfect man, because he had spent years learning from his failure to be just that. It was overwhelming for her and she knew that it would take awhile to sink in. But for now, she was content to relax herself in his arms, marveling over how one person could have possibly loved her that much.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the decision about sports is a personal one.  The issue arises if you endanger others in pursuit of your sport.  If you are endangering people not involved, or if rescuers have to put their own safety at risk to aide you because of an accident, then I believe you have crossed a line.   n the other hand, if it is just your own risk and only your own choice to endanger yourself, I don't think that's necessarily
 a problem.  There are times when people go hiking and climbing in inclement weather and get stranded, In those cases rescue teams have to venture into the same danger, but they have not made that choice, aside from signing on to be a life saver.  Other times, these sports can put at risk spectators, or even the general public, due to the hazardousness of the activity, free climbing and base jumping can imperil those below, skiing off the track can cause avalanches.  There is nothing wrong with extreme sports, but the participant should demonstrate responsibility not to put others in danger, or to rescue the person themselves if necessary, or at the very least insure adequate safety precautions.  Therefore, whether it is selfish depends on the person, not the sport.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are definitely better than reading books. In this modern world, a lot of us have very little time to read books, but audiobooks are basically giving us the experience of reading in little chunks of time. Sure people do read books as a hobby and other people are 100% disagreeing with me, but one thing for sure is that you do gain the same benefits from listening to an audiobook as you do from reading a book.

Maybe I do read without taking in too much of what I just read, but sometimes, I get the detail wrong or remember them incorrectly because of a word that I misread, and if I would have just waited and read it later and most likely wrote the word out correctly I would've had a greater understanding. But with an audiobook, I can take in so much more and it's also very entertaining. There's no misconception about what I'm listening to and no misspelling of words based on how I hear them. I'm there to just bask in the conversations knowing I could be learning so much more.

With audiobooks, you also can multitask. Being at home all the time and working from home, I don't like to be limited to what I can do, and audiobooks allow me to be able to finish my work but also listen at the same time, to pass the time and to learn. With regular books, you need to be concentrated on what you're reading, and I find it exhausting to do that, which is why I end up only reading one book a year! Audiobooks do not make the reader less knowledgeable, but they make them more productive, they can use their time to fall completely in love with the characters and to really understand the meaning of the book.

It's a common misconception. When adaptation of books have come to TV shows and movies, naysayers say that it's not as good as reading a book because all you focus on is the movie and not the characters in your head. Which is arguably true, if you have a great imagination and a great patience to read a whole book. But unfortunately for many of us, we don't have the time and we get bored and put the book down and would rather watch the movie. It's the same thing with audiobooks, but this time, the details you have are more accurate, they are there to listen to, there are speeches that you can listen to for hours.

Sometimes, the author of the book is also the one to read you the audiobook. Not only this is a great way for self-expression, but also a great way for the audience to understand the emotion behind what's being read. Emotion through intonation, reading speed and voice instill so much more to the listener than just reading. If the author intends to interpret the book how the reader wants to, then sure, books are better. But for authors that tell a story the way they want to tell it, then audiobooks are perfect.

So yeah, in this modern world, books are evolving to, and so should you. We are more busy and society requires us to multitask, so audiobooks are the ideal books for us to do it.

I love listening to Audiobooks. It is wonderful to listen while doing something else, instead of the usual staring at a page. Surprisingly, it still allows you to absorb the story richly and in the same ways as with reading. The voices of the narrators are so captivating that you begin to almost forget the fact that it's a book, and you are only listening to it and not reading it.

 would definitely recommend it to others who feel like they don't have the time to read or would prefer to listen than read.
 In my opinion, it's just as good, if not better, to listen to than reading the physical copy. 
TThe voice actors bring the characters to life and take the book to a whole different level. The ability to read in various accents and with different voice levels are only some of the features you get which you wouldn't experience otherwise. 
I've read hundreds of books in my life, and find that there is a metamorphosis when reading an audiobook.
 Your mind allows you to visualize the story as if you were watching a movie, and each actor's voice is unique in its presentation - that becomes an added feature you cannot get with a physical book.

Audiobooks have all the benefits of hardcopy books, and even more flexibility. You can carry around a whole library in your pocket on an mp3 player and can listen to it at the gym, commuting, and multitask with whatever else you may have to do. You are able to be involved in a book, wile doing chores, working out, or cooking. 

Audiobooks can intrigue children in a way regular books never can. The young reader can listen to the words in their own voice and that of the narrator's, making them feel more comfortable with spoken language. It also enables them to read along with each character. Audiobooks encourage children to join the book themselves by creating character voices, moving their lips as the characters move theirs, and sneaking a peek at the pictures whenever the scene changes!

Audiobooks are accessible. Any book in the library may be obtained as an audiobook, and there is no waiting list. 
udiobooks are also considerably less expensive than print books.
 A popular print book can cost $15-$20 at the library or other bookstore, but a popular audiobook costs less than $10. There are also numerous free audiobooks in various formats available through our public library. 
Audiobooks allow you to consume more printed material and explore more subjects than you would otherwise.
 For example, you might read a magazine article or other short text in your own time, but with audiobooks you can consume a much broader topic while you're doing something else. You could be listening to a book on beekeeping while you're driving to work, and in the process learn audibly about other books and current issues. 

Audiobooks make an excellent gift, and can be a great tool for personal growth. The level of character detail, enhanced storytelling, ease of access, and flexibility of Audiobooks make them the clear winner!",33,7,1,2,23,33,29,4,10,19,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0.7575757575757576,0.46956521739130436

You were watching the news when you first heard of the first case of such a side effect being observed, a young man, who looked no older than 22, who lapsed into a deep coma.

It was determined that while aging was reversed, given time, the body would soon slow down all bodily processes, placing the person into a deep sleep. It was determined that such a side effect took a significant amount of time, but seemed to coincide with people aging into their 70s and 80s, if they didn't take the drug. The drug was quickly recalled, and governments around the world began to investigate a potential cure.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing that I learned in school was mathematics.  Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old.

I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college.

So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television.

Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right.

I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. 

School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. 

School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that you take it seriously and enjoy it because it's done before you know it.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

In human history on earth, there have been only 100 humans who could wield mana.  Some of them became kings.  Other went mad due to the power that they held.  And a few were able to use their power for the greater good.   Wielding mana was a double-edged sword.  For that reason, many human beings in the past were afraid of this ancient power.

Now, human beings look to mana as their liberator.  The hostile aliens that attacked earth have led a ruthless campaign to exterminate humans on this planet.  Rumors about mana arose after the aliens went on their rampage.   It was believed that humans would be able to turn the tables on their enemy.   

In order to wield mana, you had to be descended from someone who could wield mana.  If you had any chance to wield this force, it would happen around your 31st birthday.  So many people were being killed that many people never made it to their 31st birthday.   Thankfully, Caerus survived to her 31st birthday.     

Caerus was descended from the first, rumored mana user.  When Caerus turned 31, she remarked that she started to feel an intense heat inside of her.  It looked like she had come down with a terrible sickness.  On her birthday, a fever overtook her.  She laid in her bed until she had to urge to run outside.   When she did, her hands started to glow with a sort of heat.  Instinctively, she threw her hands to the sky and yet out a piercing scream.   Red energy flowed into the sky.  It seemed to reach the stratosphere

Little did the people around her know, Caerus had sped up the awakening of those who could wield mana.  Throughout the world, the descendants of mana wielders were overcome with their awakenings.  They filled the sky with red energy.   This would be the start of the humans war against the aliens.  The odds have no turned to their favor.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I would not watch or read something because of an offensive and exaggerated stereotypical caricature of a certain race, for example, a typical stereotypical caricature is of Asian males in movies being nerdy, gay, a villain or the super duper nice guy which has been prevalent in movies in the 80s and 90s. One very obvious and cliche character was the Asian guy named, ""Long Duck Dong"" in The Breakfast Club. Just by reading his name alone you can see the subtle stereotypical racism.

Being half Asian myself, these issues are close to heart for me and it's something I didn't even contemplate until I was in my early 20s. It honestly didn't affect me badly because I grew up in an enclave with a lot of Asians, so we were pretty much the norm. But then once I got in my 20s and ventured out into other states I experienced this type of stereotypical racism on occasion. I was so confused about it at first and then I became angry. I remember one guy muttering under his breath, ""Me love you long time"" which is a reference to the movie Platoon with that scene of the Asian female prostitute who said that infamous line. 

There's so many more examples that I could use but I know a lot more people are aware of these stereotypical caricatures these days and Asians are definitely starting to break the mold which is a great thing. People are giving Asians much more wider and realistic roles to play in movies and shows now which makes me happy to see like Riverdale for instance, or Crazy Rich Asians. Asians are humans just like anyone else and just like anyone else Asians have their geeky/nerdy types, jock types, popular ditzy types, ladies' man type and everything from one end of the spectrum to the other. I can understand if a movie or show has a role of an Asian man or woman that's dorky/nerdy and that's ok as long as it's not stereotypical and as long as those are not the only types of roles Asians are getting.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.  Schools can do any combination of these suggestions to help students who are experiencing period poverty.  This can hopefully improve the health and wellness of the students for all of their years in school.",24,7,7,1,9,15,10,5,0,10,0.041666666666666664,0.2916666666666667,0.4166666666666667,0.45288753799392095

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, tampons and pads are similar to toilet paper, soap, and other products that are already provided in schools because they are hygiene products. Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it.

So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them.

Being male, I of course have never experienced ""period poverty"" or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. With all of these policies in effect, hopefully school will be a more comfortable and supportive place for young women who are menstruating, and it will become clear to everyone that periods do not define women in any kind of a negative way. 

After all, young women are just as human as any of the boys and men in the school, and deserve to be treated as such, and if they are, I am confident that periods will soon be one of those things that nobody in public school even thinks about anymore.",21,7,0,1,13,19,17,2,0,17,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.4329501915708812

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, it's important to limit the amount of screen time anyone spends. This is especially true with children, and the amount of time that they spend in front of a screen. 
Screen time comes with a price tag.
 While it is interactive, and can be social as well, it synthesizes an environment outside of our everyday world. It is possible to become too engrossed by this simulated world. When the world of screens becomes our predominant reality, we can become increasingly detached from ‘reality’ and exist more and more in the limbo of virtual reality. An extreme example of this, though not an uncommon one, is the rise of the gamer class. Gamers spend hours and hours every day, every week, every month and every year playing virtual reality games. This can make interacting in the world outside of their games more of a challenge than it already is for young people. 

A gamer may have difficulties reading social cues, they may have difficulties organizing their lives, they may have difficulties functioning in the world. Of course, this can be said of anyone who has spent too much time behind the soft glow of a virtual world. 
I do not believe that there is a right canned amount of how much screen time someone should use.
 I do, however, believe that there are signs that a user is overindulging in screen time. Those signs include anything from distracting yourself with work, to constantly being on your phone while interacting with people in ‘real’ life. Finding reasons to get in front of a screen, when there are other options available, is a sign that a person should take a look at how much time they are spending in virtual space. 
Being wary of screen time is not out of line with appreciating the benefits that our devices provide.
 In this modern world, we are going to need to use our screens for the practical aspects of their functionality. We need them for work, and they can be an enjoyable getaway for someone who is looking for a break from their day. I would only caution that this screen time should never become a replacement for living in the world. If it does, then I believe that you are overindulging in your screen time.",25,6,11,1,7,9,8,1,1,7,0.04,0.44,0.32,0.48497854077253216

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In this digital age, I believe many are subjected to a lot of information, much more than is feasible to keep track of, to check the accuracy and validity of such information. In comparison to how things were in the past, we are bombarded with a lot more information, that goes beyond what is happening locally, to events that are all around the world. That isn't to say that is an inherently bad thing, in the past many of the injustices and issues that occurred worldwide would never be noted by people from other countries, who were primarily preoccupied with their own issues and struggles.  n fact, Ithink it is important to be aware of what is going on in the world, band the amount of information available to people allows them to be better citizens who are informed about the problems others in their country face, but also the problems that affects others in other countries as well. I however understand that being engaged and informed is a difficult matter in its own right, and that it is not practical or reasonaule to assume others will eep up
 with every event occurring in the world at a given point in time. 

Nonetheless, people should ideally have an idea of some events that are going on in the world, that goes beyond simply knowing just the basic gist of said story. Ideally, people should be able to inform others they meet up with regarding such events, to bring awareness to potential causes to people who can take action, or do something about it. I believe that doing such and effectively engaging with current events not only brings about discussion, but also action and change for the betterment of people. I have this line of thinking based on my own observations on how people engage with news, and the actions they take from being informed. For example, in the pat I have seen people who are informed about the refugee crisis in Syria, and how it is affecting people, take action to help those affected through volunteer work and donations to charity. This could easily not have occured had people not engaged with the news that are available to them, and the information present and accesible during the current digital age. Although as I mentioned many might hear said news and not engage with it to the same degree as others, I believe it isn't inherently difficult based on the demands and obligations many people have, which might make it more difficult for them to keep up with the news. As long as others do keep up with the news, to bring about discussion, action, and change for the better, it will be an overall positive outcome for people to have such information readily available through different formats and medias.",18,6,10,0,2,6,3,3,1,2,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.1111111111111111,0.4349442379182156

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As it turns out, you are about to be reincarnated as a girl named Soeurette, whose parents are on the brink of divorce. The father loves his daughter very much, but the mother despises her, and has already found herself a younger boyfriend. Unfortunately for Soeurette, she is getting caught up in this mess, and the result is a bit of a heart-breaking roller coaster ride. Even worse, Soeurette has to go live with her mother, because her father got a new job in another state all the way across the country. Soeurette is upset, but her father promises to visit often. The first night that Soeurette spends with her mother and her mother's new boyfriend, she is abused by them, including being raped.  The whole experience is incredibly traumatizing for Soeurette. She decides to file a police report against her mother and her mother's boyfriend. She is very brave, but things do not work out so well for her. She gets sent to a girls' home, where she meets a new friend named Lucie. Lucie, however, is a girl with a dark past, and she and Soeurette become very close friends. Soeurette feels that she can confide in Lucie, but little does she know that Lucie is a manipulative girl, and will use that trust to her advantage. Lucie cons Soeurette into being her friend and Soeurette ends up performing tasks like a slave for Lucie. For example, if Lucie wants to snitch extra bread from the dining hall, she forces Soeurette to do it. Soeurette doesn't like this, but she does it anyway. Lucie always dangles the friendship over Soeurette's head since she knows Soeurette needs her friendship to survive this awful girls' home. 
Things take a turn for the worse for Soeurette when she is accused of stealing clothes from the girls' home.
 But really, Soeurette only did that because Lucie commanded her to. Soeurette gets punished badly for it, and she is so upset that she runs away from the girls' home. She is now on her own, running on the lam. But her father hears wind of Soeurette's predicament and is totally perplexed by how this could have happened. He decides to fly out to Soeurette's location so he can talk some sense into her. He finds Soeurette and admonishes her, but then he realizes that she is being forced to do these things at the girls' home. Soeurette's father feels guilty that he abandoned his daughter and made her live with an abusive mother and her abusive boyfriend. So Soeurette's father says he will move back to where Soeurette lives and will take care of her. He says Soeurette can stay with him and she will leave the girls' home. Soeurette is absolutely thrilled by this and immediately accepts her dad's offer. The father makes sure Soeurette's mother will sign the papers allowing Soeurette to leave the girls' home.

In my opinion, we should worry about excessive screen time. We have a whole generation growing up without knowing who their real friends are, or what a real relationship feels like to be friends with somebody. It’s so much easier to be mean to somebody on the other side of a screen, and then you can just “unfriend"" them. 


ocial interaction is being lost, because people are spending more time just being on their screens and watching videos.
 Kids are growing up without learning that they can share their feelings directly with a person. It’s all about, “I’ll send you a message, and we’ll use texting and chatrooms instead."" People are being held away at a distance, instead of being able to sit in the same room and talk to somebody. t’s a whole different way of socializing.



We’re all living in our own little bubbles, instead of being out in the real world—seeing who we’re really friends with. Social interaction is becoming very one-sided, with technology becoming people’s best and only friends. We’re all so busy trying to tweet the best hashtag, or say something that will get a ""Share"" or a “Like,"" that we’re not taking the time to acknowledge the human being right in front of us. We’re in the middle of what I worry is becoming a permanent societal isolation. 
My mom went into a meeting with a school teacher who told her the kids aren’t playing in the playground anymore.
 They have these iPads, and they’re at their own little table by themselves. There’s no crossing over and talking to each other, or hearing a different voice than their own. They don’t hear stories; they don’t hear the sounds and smells. They’re growing up missing all those things. 

I worry that the hearing and speech development of young children is being damaged, because they’re not using their mouths or their ears to hear and understand the different sounds of real-life speech.   Many of them can’t sit still, because they are driven by a need to have their mind stimulated. Children are growing up at a faster pace than any generation before, and they’re not learning how to deal with real humans. 
I’m scared that we’re growing up to be a generation without human interaction, without seeing human faces.
 We might not learn empathy, and how to handle human emotions. The real world is becoming a screen world. It seems to me that we’re in danger of losing our humanity.

Was it magic? Aliens? Foreign conspiracy? An elaborate hoax? No one seemed to know. But all of those kitschy mugs were suddenly more than just mugs. 

No one was really sure what to do. Should they throw them away? But they had been gifts from kids for the most part. One of the best gifts a Dads can receive.

But now there was a different kind of awkwardness - what about households with no moms? That was a conversation no one wanted to have.

Eventually a movement formed. A group called ""The Mugs of Equality"" started producing and distributing a new kind of mug. The #1 Family mug. Everyone who turned in a #1 Dad mug got a #1 Family mug in exchange. The group distributed them at churches, schools and community events. And all mug makers agreed not to make #1 Dad mugs anymore.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this is not even a question that should be asked.  Of course schools should be providing free pads and tampons to students.  

I should point out, right from the beginning, that I have never experienced period shaming or period poverty.  As you might have guessed, I am a member of the other half of the population, that will literally never have this experience.  However, as a member of the human race, I feel it is necessary to look out for the needs of those who do.
Currently, in the United States, although Title 10, Section 5131.6 of Law states that public schools should provide menstrual and breast
-feeding supplies to students.  So it is already a matter of law.  Since laws can be changed, however, I hope to convince you that these programs should not be cut.
Before I continue, I would like to talk about toilet paper for a moment.
  Imagine if you had to rush to the restrooms between classes, and once you were finished, you realized that there was no toilet paper in your stall.  You politely ask the person next to you to pass some under the walls, but he or she refuses.  This other person tells you that you should have planned ahead, and, besides, your bodily functions are disgusting and you should not be talking about them.  Does this sound far-fetched to you?  It should, because no one would behave like that other person.

And yet this is what women and girls are subjected to on a daily basis when it comes to their periods.  They are mocked and shamed for their natural, healthy biological function.  And if they can't afford the necessary sanitary supplies, or simply can't afford them, many people have no problem in blaming the victim.  We say that she should have planned ahead, or should have been more responsible.  This is simply unacceptable.  Schools should be prepared to help these students because it is the right thing to do, and also, because students will not be able to learn otherwise.
IBesides, i the schools already have free toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids, etc. then they should also have free pads and tampons
.  All of us are equal, and all lives matter (as some opponents of my viewpoint are eager to point out), so we all deserve some basic accommodations.  Toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids are all necessary to our health.  They are not free, yet we never think twice about providing them in public to those who are in need, because health and sanitation are important and necessary for everyone.  Reproductive health should be treated the same as any other public-health issue.  If toilet paper is necessary for every student and public-health issue, then so are pads and tampons.  

If you have some objection to the cost of these supplies, just ask yourself if you would be willing to give up free toilet paper, soap, and Band-Aids in public.  If it's not acceptable when it happens to you, then it's not acceptable when it happens to anyone.

In my opinion, dating apps are the best way to find the right person for you. I have been using them for a while now and I have met some great people. It is much easier, quicker and more efficent to find people who line up with more of what you want in a person. You are also more likely to find new things that you like about people because you are exposed to many more then trying to pick a mate out a club or anywhere else. You literally have access to hundreds or thousands of single people in your area using these apps. Many more fish in the sea that you can potentially catch.  have also found that the people who use these apps are more serious about finding someone. if that is what your are looking for or the exact opposite is always available if that will tickle your fancy. Its also way safer to meet someone online and interact with them first before meeting them in person. You can get a good feel for a person using all the tools at your disposal. You can see their pictures, read their profile, see what they like and dislike all while talking to them in real time. I realize that you feelings may all change when you meet in person but its still much more efficient then trying to find people in person. The algorithms used to match people are also getting better and better as time goes and the tools that go along with them. 
While I realize dating apps are not for everyone, but they are useful to most. They are much better at finding you a mate then your are in a personal setting. Not just a little better but several orders of magnitude better. I personally will never try the old ways again.",25,9,13,0,3,7,3,4,2,1,0.0,0.52,0.12,0.5013404825737265

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a person is the one that makes them seem like a stereotype. This type of portrayal shows no creativity at all. There is no substance behind characters like this which in my opinion shows a lack of work ethic and creativity.

I wouldn't not watch a show or movie if a character was a stereotypical portray of a certain race, religion or ethnicity but it might bother me. Tony Soprano to me was somewhat of the stereotypical Italian mob boss but I loved that show. 

There are certain stereotypes that I hate seeing on TV and in movies. For example, the dumb blonde girl is one that is used so often and is just such a terrible portrayal of blonde women. I personally know many blonde women who are very intelligent and even run their own businesses.

I just feel like stereotypical portrayals are easy. They have been done to death. I would rather see a character that is more of an original. One that has some depth to them. You typically don't see that with stereotypical characters because the stereotype is their personality. 

Stereotypes in movies and film just annoy me to be honest. They turn me off. When I'm watching a movie or a television show I don't want to see characters and dialogue similar to things I have seen for decades. I want new, I want fresh and I want complex personalities.

The best characters are the ones that stand out and are unique. Stereotypes aren't unique. They're tired and boring. I've had enough of them in movies and TV. They're overdone.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the answer to the question of whether it is selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing is a resounding ""no."" I think anyone that wants to pursue a sport, no matter how dangerous, should be able to do so. We are free to make our own choices in life, and if we want to risk our lives for the thrill of it, then that is our choice. Some people do these things to test their limits, and others do it for the adrenaline rush.

 Sports should be played safely, but if someone wants to risk their life to do something, then they should be able to do so. There should always be clear safety guidelines that allows for the amount of risk-taking required in participating. There should be adequate preparedness before partaking in any dangerous sport and always have a plan in case of emergency.

Dating apps effectively have people compare themselves with others, specifically in terms of how attractive they are as a potential date. The app primarily showcases only the positive aspects of a person, which includes their achievements, skills, experience, and more. The app might skew the perceptions of its users, who feel that they are alone in the negative outcomes that they face, as they don't get to hear or know what struggles other users go through via the dating app. This can make people feel less attractive, which could bring their confidence levels down. For those reasons, I have stuck primarily to dating in person, as I can learn more about a person, without having them omit both the negative and positive aspects of themselves. That isn't to say others can't do the same online, it is simply more difficult based on anonymity and the nature of dating apps.

As for other forms of technology, I think they overall improve the aspects of dating. Netflix and similar forms of entertainment are a good way for people to bond and enjoy themselves in watching entertainment, such as shows that they find interesting. Texting and social media helps people dating stay in contact with one another, allowing them to talk to someone when they need their voice heard, or when they feel they have something worth sharing. If used correctly, these forms of communication and interactions can help a relationship thrive. That being said, such technology and interactions can be destructive or hurtful for relationships and romantic interactions. For these, a sense of privacy and respect still ought to be preserved. A person should controlling who a person talks to online, nor should they read their personal texts if the person does not consent to doing so. This along with other negative behaviors are ways that technology may impair romantic interactions. However, with proper care, I believe many do utilize technology in a positive manner, and that they are able to strengthen their romantic interactions through said technology.",28,9,15,0,4,5,4,1,2,2,0.0,0.5357142857142857,0.14285714285714285,0.4517374517374517

In my opinion, what you should learn in school is how to think.  It should broaden your horizons and show you there is a bigger world. 
TAnothermimportant thing  have learned is that with literacy you can learn anything.
  That's not solely literacy from written matter either.   It includes the ability to comprehend and interpret spoken or written information.   

Critical thinking is an important tool in going forward in life.  Everything cannot be true.  You have to learn to think things through logically.   The more you practice critical thinking, the clearer your brain will become.

School needs to prepare people to be citizens of a democracy.  Without citizens who can think, think critically and learn a democracy will not flourish but will die.  here is a difference between being literate and educated.
   A person can read and write but may not have the intellectual ability to understand or draw correct inference from that information.  This is were school steps in.

In the past, rote learning and memorization were the rule.  In some countries this type of education still flourishes.  It can produce very high test scores.  However, that has been slowly changing as educators and businesses have found that what they need are people who can apply what they have learned to novel situations, in other words, generalize.  What is needed is the ability to think, not just memorize.

Instituting this type of education has been difficult for schools as many parents are not fans.  They don't want to see their children not get good grades on standardized tests.  School administrators face backlash from governmental bodies when standardized test scores are low as well.  This is a big issue for educators.

 At least, that was the original idea behind it. The company that made them wanted to do this as a fun campaign to draw attention to the mugs. People just bought them as a silly novelty item so something had to be done to bring them back to life on social media. 
But when they changed the mug rankings, they didn't expect people to treat it so seriously.
 They were amazed at the amount of people who called them to complain that they had been personally offended by the new mug rankings. The company was happy that so many people were talking about the mugs. They were just surprised that people felt so extreme about it. 
There are even people who have bought the mug on purpose to taunt their wives and mothers-in-law.
 People were finding new uses for the mugs. Sales were through the roof. The newest craze was showing your ranking, good or bad. People were pretty desperate for attention these days after all. 
The company still has very high hopes for the campaign.
 They believed this was just the start. They could now use all of this interest and start producing mugs for moms, for children, for bosses. Everyone would get a ranking.
By the end of the year, there will be entire sets of ""Best Mom"", ""Most Handsome Dad"", and ""Bossiest

 The company will have an oversaturation issue where people won't be needing or wanting any more of these mugs for a long time. It didn't matter though, they'd have enough money from this that they'd do fine financially until then. 

So they company released every possible self ranking mug possible. Every person and animals ended up getting a personalized ranking. Eventually the rankings just became meaningless because the next social media craze hit. Short attention spans are to be expected these days, so the company now begins work on the next great mug.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is when they are portrayed as a stereotype. It shows that the people who created the show or the movie don't understand the depths of a character and are shallow people in general. 

There are many stereotypes in TV and film that make me cringe. A racist white man, a ""gangster"" black man, a dumb blonde all come to mind for me.  These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality.

That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. 

There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression.

The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show. 

That to me is a stereotype done right, even though stereotypes have a negative stigma around them. And realistically, all stereotypes are negative. Some just don't offend me to a great extent.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture. 

I also find stereotypes to be used less and less due to the societal backlash that comes with it. An audience isn't going to accept offensive stereotypes in movies and TV just because they're playing a character. The character has to have depth to them. 

Stereotypes are wrong. They're just a way to get a cheap reaction out of a viewing audience. Some directors take pride in their work, and sadly some directors don't. ",33,4,28,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0.0,0.8484848484848485,0.030303030303030304,0.47668393782383417

---

In my opinion, there is a place for stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows. However, there also are stereotypical characters that make me cringe such as the dumb blonde or the poor immigrant.

I look at certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano or Walter White. One is a stereotypical Italian. The other is a stereotypical top level drug seller. Both of those characters are revered and loved and nobody even remembers that they were stereotypical. When the stereotype isn't the main focus, the characters can work. Hence why the dumb blonde makes me cringe. The entire character is simply that she is blonde and therefore is dumb.

There is no depth to her character. And to me, that is offensive. It also shows a lack of focus and care from the author or writer of the book/movie. You're basically taking a shortcut. 

A stereotypical character could turn me off enough where I would stop watching a television show. I don't really read much so that is a bit irrelevant for me. I just find stereotypes wrong. I think most people do. 

Any time we are generalizing a person rather than taking in their individualism and personality, it's offensive. It's wrong. And sadly it's still a major issue in many countries.

I hope we can get to a point in time where stereotypes are the past. But we're in the Year 2021 and racism is still alive. It just doesn't seem like we're ever going to get there because there are too many bad apples in the bunch. 

So yes, a stereotypical character can make me cringe. At the same time, I am guilty of enjoying certain stereotypical characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White. Hopefully in the future there are more characters like Tony Soprano and Walter White where the stereotype isn't thought about, and less characters like the dumb blonde where the stereotype is the entire personality of the character.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there are many potential downsides and benefits to the constant use of our devices, depending on their content, context and purpose. For example, it’s been linked to low social competence in younger kids, as a distraction from family bonding, and a risk factor for obesity. However screen time also allows for younger kids to learn new things by using apps and using the internet. 

Screen time simply needs to be used in moderation. Social media is very similar. There are pros and cons to everything but when you overuse something it becomes a negative. There’s a reason that if you overuse coffee, it’ll make you feel anxious and irritable. A cell phone or a tablet can work the same way. It also can damage your eyes.

Screen time during the pandemic was on the rise simply because we all were stuck at home. There wasn't much to do. Screens probably kept us from going insane. Imagine being stuck at home and not being able to use the internet or watch television. What would people who live alone do? Stare at a wall?

Screen time is beneficial to humans. It allows us to have basically any information at our fingertips. It allows us to relax and wind down. It allows us to keep our mind off the problems and issues that we face on a daily basis. It also allows us to keep in contact with our family and friends via FaceTime and texting. 

In general I believe that screen time isn't a real issue for most of the population. As long as you keep it in moderation and it isn't affecting your physical or mental well being, do what you enjoy in life. ",27,6,18,0,3,5,4,1,2,2,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.5725806451612904

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, if a university or college is profiting off of a student athlete, the student athlete should be paid monetarily and not via scholarship. A student athlete getting paid would not the economy of universities. The amount that these schools make off of the student athletes is incredible. We're talking about millions and in some case billions of dollars and the student athletes don't see a cent of that. 

I do understand the point that student athletes would become a bidding war for universities that have a lot of capital. I don't see that as any difference than free agency in sports. Typically the highest bidder will win but there are some cases where an athlete wants to be close to home or takes a hometown discount. At the very least, the student athlete should have to weigh those options.

The easy way to solve that issue as well is simply to limit the amount that a student athlete can make. $250,000 is a fantastic salary for a student athlete and is life changing money for any 18 to 22 year old. You can put a specific criteria on the salary such as maintaining a 2.0 GPA each semester or their salary is forfeited or at the very least a portion is. This allows there to be fair competition between the universities and a school like Alabama won't be able to simply outbid a school like Syracuse.

Student athletes are working as a full time athlete and a full time student. Shouldn't they be paid for their efforts? What happens if a student athlete gets both a academic and an athletic scholarship? That student is punished if they get a full ride for both categories. They are entitled to 2X the scholarship amount and instead just get one scholarship amount. 

The business of college athletics has been a scam for way too long. Student athletes have been exploited by universities for far too long. You have coaches like Clemson's Dabo Swinney saying that student athletes shouldn't be paid and that he'd retire if they did. Well, a bill was passed that allows student athletes to get paid for their imagine and likeness. Did Swinney retire? Of course not. He makes upwards of 10 million dollars a year. Imagine that. A coach making 10 million dollars a year while his players make absolutely nothing.

Again, a scenario where most logical and reasonable people will look at and say ""that is unfair."" The only people who will say that it's fair are the people that are making tons of money off of those student athletes. 

Luckily, more and more people who have power have seen this issue and have acted in the student's favor. I look forward to more laws and bills being passed that allows student athletes to get their fair share of money. ",38,9,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.7631578947368421,0.0,0.47213622291021673

So she believes that kidnapping Matt Damon and bringing him back to her home planet, Cyborg, is the best way for her to make it rain and for her to get a payday. 
What she doesn't realize is that the human race will stop at nothing to get their beloved Matt Damon back.
 The human race is going to make it extremely difficult for Rayne to actually cash out on her payday since they are going to make it near impossible to actually get the bounty owed to her for kidnapping him. In fact, the human race, upon discovering the Matt Damon is not home, immediately assembled task forces around the world to try to locate Matt Damon's exact location. 
It takes the human race forever to find out where Matt Damon is, but once they do, they will send one of their best agents to
 retrieve him. The human race pinpoints Matt Damon's exact location on the spacecraft that the alien has taken off with him in. They then discover that the spacecraft is headed toward Cyborg, which is located in the Andromeda Galaxy. Due to the distance it takes so long for them to figure out where Matt Damon is, they send an elite human agent after him, who eventually catches up. This elite agent's name is Barth. Barth has a storied pedigree and is an incredibly talented agent. He has never lost a case before and he is not about to let Matt Damon be the first.

Barth tells the alien to let go of Matt Damon, or things could get really ugly. The alien thinks that she is in charge, but Barth insists that he's the one in charge. The two bicker for a bit and then the alien realizes that this whole situation is just fruitless. So she agrees to release Matt Damon. 
Upon his release, Matt Damon tells the alien and Barth that he's going to go back home.
 He's had enough of this kidnapping nonsense. He's going to go home and maybe start a family. Maybe he'll find some nice human woman to settle down with. The alien is very sad to see Matt Damon go. But Barth totally understands Matt Damon's desire to settle down with some semblance of normalcy after the bizarre kidnapping experience that he's just gone through. Barth promises to take Matt Damon back to his hometown on planet Earth so that Matt Damon can recuperate and regain his mental health after such a harrowing experience. 
Before he leaves for Earth, Matt Damon asks the alien if she's going to be all right.
 The alien, sad as she is about Matt Damon's departure, smiles at Matt Damon and nods. The alien knows that Matt Damon is actually quite the gentleman. If anyone had to escape her capture, it was a good thing it was Matt Damon, since the alien had actually grown somewhat of a soft spot for the man. 
The alien watches as Matt Damon, Barth, and the spacecraft take off.
 Barth takes Matt Damon home, and Matt Damon rests, relaxes and tries to forget the whole experience of ever having been kidnapped.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---
Extreme sports, while dangerous, are often well-known by its participants and understood regarding the dangers they might face. Many people would not undertake a severe mountain climb, if they are not prepared to do so. Other sports that involve risk, such as downhill cycling, occur in areas that the participants are probably more familiar and comfortable with, for example, at an area they train or practice in. Like other sports, extreme sports require effort and time from its athletes, who take the initiative to train themselves to meet the demands of the sport. For many, extreme sports possess benefits and aspects of it that are not as easily obtained in regular sports, that motivates select individuals to pursue them as hobbies.
The spirit of physical exertion and camaraderie that many extreme sport preserves myre a ositive aspects of the sport.
 Those that accomplish great feats in extreme sports can have their achievements recorded for others to hear about, which might motivate them as well as others to continue to achieve their aspirations and goals. While the stakes may be higher, extreme sports are still considered a sport because they require the same amount of training and time as other sports would for an athlete to achieve such feats. Thus, I doubt their is a universal standard to deem sports as too dangerous to pursue, given that for some, pursuing a sport would be too dangerous and risky, while for others it would be a worthwhile use of their time. 

I think it would be against the spirit of sport to outright prohibit such sports due to potential risks of injury. Many sports that are not considered to be extreme sports are also dangerous and could cause injury to the user. These sports are well observed, and many take the requisite precautions to reduce the frequency and severity of injuries. This is done through proper training, physical prowess, and more. Just like how someone that is inexperienced can injury themselves more often than a professional in a sport, so too can a person put themselves at risk while doing an extreme sport that they are not familiar with. Te safety of sextreme sports coanbe improved, and  recautions tcan be aken to reduce the risk of injury and death.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

In my opinion, technology affects dating and relationships for the better! I'm a girl named Soeurette who met my fiance Matt online through Tinder. Now, I know what you're probably thinking. Tinder is a hookup app, right? I mean, it's not like I met him on eHarmony or Match.com. And it's certainly not like I met him at church or through a mutual friend. Yes, I know that the old fashioned way to meet probably makes for a better story to tell our future kids, but I'm not complaining. Tinder has been a great way for me to meet people. While it's true that I've met a lot of guys who were just looking for a hookup, I've also met some really great guys on Tinder. And Matt is one of them. 

When I first came across Matt's profile on Tinder, I was immediately attracted to him. I mean, he's a tall, handsome, blue-eyed guy who loves to travel and has a great sense of humor. He was also a few years older than me, which I liked. I'm a girl who likes dating older guys. Plus, I'm a girl who likes to be in control, and I knew that Matt was a guy who would let me take the lead. Not only that, but he also had a great job, because he works in finance at JPMorgan. Now, I don't like to think of myself as a gold digger or anything, but I'm a girl who likes to be taken care of. And I certainly don't mind being spoiled. I don't necessarily have the best job, because I work as an admission associate at a school called St. Hilda's in New York. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty low-paying job, especially because I have to support my daughter from my first marriage on that salary. But Matt has a great job, and he's been really good about supporting me and my daughter. 

So, I decided to swipe right on Matt's profile.
 We went on our first date at a bar in New York. It was a little dive bar place on the Upper West Side, right in my neighborhood. We had a great time, and I was really attracted to him. We talked for hours, and I really enjoyed getting to know him. That night, he walked me home, and we kissed. And then he asked me if he could come inside. Of course I said yes without hesitation, because by that point I was really into him. I couldn't even keep my hands off of him when we got inside. We started making out, and I took him to my bedroom. I took off his shirt and started kissing his chest. I took off my shirt, and he started kissing my breasts. I took off his pants, and he started kissing my inner thighs. I took off my pants, and he started eating me out. I came in his mouth, and he came on my stomach. We fell asleep in each other's arms, and it was the best night of my life.

Honestly, I have Tinder to thank for that night, and I'm so grateful for it, because that night led to many more just like it! Every night we spend together is better than the last. We're getting married in less than a month now and I can't wait! If it weren't for Tinder, I never would have met Matt. And if I hadn't met Matt, I certainly wouldn't be having as much fun as I am now.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is to be able to think critically. Obviously, students should come out of school with the basics, Math, English skills, and some History.  Also, they need to learn the skills to pursue the career that they want.  After this, however, they need to be able to think critically.   This skill allows people to function as independent, productive and responsible members of the public.  They need to be able to think for themselves, and not just accept what they are told.  A functioning democracy requires its population to understand what is going on in the world and make the proper decisions, and hold their leaders to account.  Critical thinking means people won't be taken advantage of, will see things as they truly are, and will be able to make informed decisions.   This is the most important thing students should learn in school, and every lesson taught, whether math, science, social studies, should have an element of this life skill.",14,6,4,0,4,15,5,10,1,4,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.2857142857142857,0.5418502202643172

The world is in your hands.
 It is time to reclaim our power. 
The game is set in a world where Mana is the source of all power.
 The objective is to win the game by adding the most Mana to the collective pot. Mana is gained by playing cards. Each card is either worth Mana or holds the power to take Mana from another source. 
The game is played in turns.
 Each turn is divided into two phases: the draw phase and the action phase. A card is drawn from the stack. Then, the player must play a card and be left with 5 cards. 
The action phase is where the player can play cards.
 The player chooses the card to play. The card is then placed in front of the player. The amount of Mana on the card will match the amount of Mana on one of the source wells on the board. The player must move to that location on the board. The player can then take the Mana from that source well and wait there until their next turn. 

There are also cards that allow the player to gain Mana from a source well without having to move their piece.  This gives players the advantage of collecting more neighboring bonuses and obtaining Mana.
The game ends when the last card is drawn from the stack.
 The player with the most Mana wins. If the game is being played in tournament mode, then the winning mana goes into the collective pot, and is divided up between the players before the start of the next game.

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are the three Rs: Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. I know this sounds kind of old school, and I do believe there are many other things students should be taught that they aren't, but honestly, we do need this in our everyday life! Where would we be if we could not read or write? And basic arithmetic is used everyday! I know I use it everyday!

If a student does not learn how to read or write, what kind of job could they ever get? How could you go about daily life? If you don't know math, how do you budget? Or know what something will cost if it is 20% off? These are skills that we are able to use without even thinking about them. This is because we have started learning these skills since before we even went to school!

I know many kids in school think they will never use math once they are out of school, but they use it when they do not even realize it. If a child does not learn how to read or write, how would they function. Think about cell phones now. We read texts on them every day. We write texts on them every day. These are skills that are needed in this day and age. 
I know that there are many other things that students should learn in school, but these are the most important.
 On top of these skills they should be taught basic life skills. Skills such as writing a check, applying for a mortgage, doing their taxes. But none of this could be done if they had not already allowed been taught reading, writing and arithmetic!
I know that I have learned many things in school that I will never use in my life.
 But I use reading, writing and math every single day. I think these subjects are the basis of all other subjects. You could not even learn other subjects  without being able to read or write. 

I think the school curriculum does need to be reevaluated. But the one thing that should never change is the core subjects of reading, writing and arithmetic. These are definitely the most important classes students should be taught as they will use them everyday for the rest of their lives.",33,6,22,0,5,11,5,6,1,4,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.15151515151515152,0.3805309734513274

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

Cody J. McDavis brings up interesting points and reasons for his stance against paying athletes. However, it does not give any considerations for how the athletes out to be compensated for their performance, efforts, and the amount of time that it takes to participate in college-level sports. For participating in such sports, athletes have to juggle various obligations, including their education. They make compromises as well, as being an athlete makes it harder for them to hold a full-time, even a part-time job. At the same time, their focus lies on getting better at their sport, striving to improve to be the best they can be. A college can offer scholarships or other financial aid to athletes, but it is not a guarantee that they would be able to pay for their tuition or other costs incurred to them at a college. 

cDavis also argues that his stance for keeping things the way they are would not hurt fans, university, and alumni.
 However, that is not necessarily true. Athletes that are not compensated for their performance and efforts can face difficulties in terms of finances, even potentially accumulate debt. Such stressors can be anxiety inducing, which ultimately affects performance. Athletes under stress and anxiety will end up performing less effectively than those that are free of such stressful occurrences in their life. All together, this compromises the perseverance of a team, which lowers their appeal to their fans, and the prestige of the university. Paying for college athletes is a small price to pay for the contributions they give to a university, and should be considered due to the positive effects it bestows on the athletes themselves.

McDavis is correct that paying athletes can lead to a discrepancy in how athletes are paid, causing a bidding war that is costly for universities to participate in and to maintain. These exorbitant prices to get the best athletes no doubt will compromise the finances of the university, which can lead to budget cuts. Some level f effort will be required to mprevenh such occurrences, such as paying all applicable student athletes a faie amount, that is comparable to one another. This avoids bidding wars, and lowers potential costs for universities. Athletes ought to be paid for their commitment and efforts to the sport, and that it should cover their expenses and serve as a means to prevent debt in their time at a university. To not pay them for their work, will only lower their overall performance, and it will be an injustice to the very people that make college sports what they are.",28,9,14,1,4,8,5,3,3,2,0.03571428571428571,0.5,0.17857142857142858,0.4805414551607445

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people should have at least a basic awareness of what's going on in the world. We can't make informed decisions at the voting poles, if we don't gather some information before we make our choices. Information, provided people actually take the time to learn from it, is terribly empowering. When we know what we are voting for, we can make responsible, informed decisions. If we don't, we aren't truly participating in the democratic process.

It's nearly impossible to keep up with every detail that comes across in a 24 hour news cycle. New organizations have a habit of sensationalizing everything, to the point that it's difficult to filtrate out all of the unimportant information that they produce. The recent election in the US taught us that it's difficult to determine what information is really true and what's just one person's opinion. Misinformation has hit new heights in the United States, adding a new, unwelcome dimension to the process of following the news. This is complicated even more when you add in all of the texts, tweets, e-mails, and facebook feeds that fill up a person's news Now, not only does a person need to process the massive amount of news available, to get their information, but they also need to read everything with a suspicious, critical mind. 
Even if people try to stay up-to-date, the sheer amount of news out there seems to be overwhelming.
 Differing opinions are the cornerstone of democracy, but today we have people purposefully filling news feeds with complete fabrications. In this day and age, news organizations are trying to fill the voids left behind by decline of investigative journalism. This is particularly dangerous to the citizens of the United States, where education has been a very low priority for many decades. This has left many people in the US without the ability to critically think about the world they live in.

As difficult as it is to obtain accurate information, we as citizens have a duty to try. We need to understand the reality of our society, before we can begin to look for ways to change it in positive ways. If we actively seek out the truth, but hold on to our skepticism, it doesn't matter if we don't catch every piece of news. We are, at the very least, consuming real information and not fabrication.

Everyone has a responsibility to do their very best to find real information, and to take time to read that information.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices. It provides us an escape during these trying times. It provides us a way to connect with loved ones. It provides us a way to stay informed. It allows us to do things virtually that we may be scared to otherwise do in person. 
I'm not saying that we should be glued to our screens.
 That can have a negative effect on us if we become too dependent on our devices. Instead, we should allow ourselves to indulge in extra screen time right now. It's a good way to escape the fear and anxiety that we may be feeling. That mobile video game that you used to play just to pass the time might now give you a way of forgetting the current pandemic. 

One way that could help make screen time be more healthy could be using it to connect with your loved ones. Maybe you could play a multiplayer game together. Or maybe you could Skype with them. Those are ways to bring us closer together right now. 

You could even use screen time to help improve yourself right now. You could be using it to try and learn a foreign language. You could use it to make a daily dairy and keep track of a project you are working on. You could use it to learn how to cook a new recipe.

When you think of all of the positive ways you can use it right now, it's hard to say that more screen time is a bad thing. It can be a good thing. It can be a healthy thing. It really just comes down to how you use it. It's like most things in life as far as just finding a healthy balance. But remember, this pandemic won't last forever. You can cut back down on screen time later. For now I'd suggest embracing it and just making the most of it.

You realize that Soeurette is cheating on Matty and then remember where you've heard of her name before. You were her lover, back when you lived in an apartment together. And more astonishingly, you realize that Harper is actually your daughter! This discovery sends you into a state of shock. You are astonished that Soeurette has remarried. She was an excellent lover -- hence the slipup resulting in Harper -- but she was not a good person. You remember that she was unfaithful and malicious. 
You continue to watch Matty's life and see that he eventually finds out that Soeurette is cheating on him.
 He is deeply hurt, and his soul goes through a process known as ""soul sickness"", where they feel the emotions of their past lives. You feel the pain he feels, and you feel the pain of every other person in the cinema. You become very angry at Soeurette. How dare she cheat on your future self? You realize she has not only been unfaithful to you, but is also likely an unfaithful person generally since she has repeated her bad behavior into the future. 
After Matty realizes that Soeurette has cheated on him, he takes their stepchild and leaves her.
 Soeurette is devastated but Matty's drastic actions serve her right. You are glad that she is being punished for her actions. The other people in the cinema are also very angry at her. They are relieved that she has been punished, and they encourage Matty to continue living his life without her. 
You see Matty move on with his life and you can tell he is extremely happy.
 He meets a woman named Vivian, who is extremely kind. Vivian is nothing like Soeurette. Vivian is the woman that Matty has always deserved. Vivian takes care of Harper like her own. Meanwhile, Soeurette is alone and miserable. She realizes her mistakes and regrets everything. She is also jealous of Vivian. You are glad that she is jealous of someone who has earned the love of Matty. 
Matty lives a long and happy life with Vivian.
 Soeurette eventually becomes a drug addict and withers away. She becomes consumed by her loss of Matty and Harper and is self-destructive for the rest of her life, just as she deserves. 
You spend the rest of your life watching Matty's many happy reincarnations, until your soul is ready to be reborn.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

Schools should provide resources and relevant items to its students, given that many might come from families that cannot afford such luxuries. Schools providing free pads and tampons is a critical action that helps female students, who naturally as they grow up experience puberty and menstrual cycles. This is a natural process that should not be shamed or hidden, and resources should be given to help female students understand the changes occurring to their body.  Offering free pads or tampons is of little cost to the schools, much less costlier than other initiatives it may undertake, but its benefit is significant for students that come from low-income families, or who might be unfamiliar with such items. Like toiletries and other sundries, pads and tampons are hygienic items that help female students feel more comfortable in their bodies, and more in control during their menstrual cycles. Like Band-Aids, they offer help to female students, and are critically needed to avoid outcomes that they rather avoid, such as staining their clothes. 

Naturally, their is a sense of privacy and urgency related to tampons and pads, given that unlike Band-Aids or similar items, many female students do not want others to know that they requested such items from the school. Therefore, schools should take heed and use caution when giving such items, doing so in a private and respectful way, that does not disclose the identity of the female students requesting such items, and maintains their anonymity. Failure to do so can lead to bullying, that shames such students for having a natural bodily process, and for essentially struggling to not afford such items. The end effects of such bullying would then be detrimental to the student, and could lead to negative outcomes, such as a decline in mental health, and a notable decrease in acadmic performance. Schools should essentially be safe havens for students to learn and acquire skills and knowledge to better prepare themselves for the future. They also serve as ways to socialize, and learn how to cooperate and engage with others. Therefore, schools should be places where students feel comfortable and safe, and should not be places where students are shamed for having a natural bodily process. Schools should ultimately provide them with the items and resources they lack for whatever reason that may be, including pads and tampons in a private and respectful manner.",20,7,10,0,3,8,3,5,2,1,0.0,0.5,0.15,0.44759825327510916

Unbeknownst to them, all of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. It seemed like an innocuous change for some, especially the dads who learned how they rank up against the other dads of the world. 
But for many, it was a bitter pill to swallow.
 Especially those that found themselves in the top 100, those that were seemingly the best of the best when it came to being a father. It was for these men that the mug changed them in a way they didn't expect. Some of them, gained an inflated ego, taking the time to gloat to the other dads whose rank was beneath them. Others were filled with jealosy and rage, unable to come to terms the fact that they weren't truly number one in the world at being a father, feeling they would be and second-rate at best. 

So forth from that day, the news found itself broadcasting crimes around the world, of the top 100 dads fighting amongst each other, arguing that they were truly better than the mugs suggested. It grew violent at times, landing many of the men in the hospital for their injuries. The weirdest occurrence however, as the media learned, was the number one rank in the world was never heard of or seen, they never made their presence known or heard. Yet, the dads never ever noticed it, they were too busy arguing with each other regarding their rank in the top 100s. What they did notice, was one day, when he irmug schanged. again. 

The news blared up to highlight the occurrence, those in the top 100s found themselves much lower ranks, reflecting their behavior in the past couple of days. Others were elated to being ranked higher than before, but their behavior never got as sour and awful as the dads that were initially seemingly ranked as the best. They were calmer, less volatile in their actions, and more mindful of what they did. However, none of the newly highly ranked dads reached the #1 position, suggesting that the previous dad that had that rank was still considered to be #1. So, the world turned its attention to finding out the best dad in the world. Months would go by, but the search would finally come to an end, being unable to find the person with the #1 mug in the world.

For the person who was ranked #1 in the world as the best dad amongst the others was actually given to a family's dog, who had raised several pups in their life. Unknown to the family of what kind of mug they truly held in their house, they spent the rest of the days taking care of their pet dog, who truly was the #1 dad in the world.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college players should earn their money through hard work.  I think it's unfair for people who get a free ride (college scholarship) while people who worked just as hard working their way through college, have to pay back debt.  It leads to favoritism in college sports. College sports superstars are treated differently than other students, and they might not even deserve it. They get more breaks from their teachers so they pass no matter the amount of work they put in. Furthermore, they are given special treatment that other students aren't given access to. College is meant to be about hard work, and the ability to succeed all without money being thrown at you. These college athletes are getting money thrown at them, the ability to travel with the team, and media attention that people who work hard to succeed don't get. They do the minimal work to pass class and practice for football, and then get rewarded for their talent. I can't think of many cases where a student would receive more money than needed to live off of for college. Having more than their peers is unfair and not moral. It goes against the values that are instilled in college students. Students work hard for what they earn, and they should be treated just like everyone else. They are free to reap the benefits of their celebrity status after graduation.  Until then, they should not be treated differently than anyone else. Colleges should strive to have more egalitarian values. ",24,9,2,0,13,17,13,4,0,13,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.5416666666666666,0.513189448441247

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the portrayal of Native Americans. I have seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans are portrayed as savages, uncivilized, and/or unintelligent. Later-dated portrayals show them as drunks, jean jacket-clad, greasy, no-lifers waiting on the side of the road for the next handout. 
I have also seen many movies and read many books where the Native Americans arnd their culture ae portrayed as wall-ise, spiritual, and/or mystical.
 They are often shown as the ""keepers of the earth"" or the ""keepers of the balance"",  the ""keepers of the ancient wisdom.""

This fetishization is damaging. People are not dichotomous. There were periods of time where tribes would murder and scalp their enemies. They would eat the heart of their foes. here were also periods of time where tribes would treat their enemies with respect and kindness., and impart wisdom and knowledge to younger generations


Native Americans have doctors, scientists, lawyers, and engineers. They also have hobos and lazy individuals, the same as any other race. 
It's time media began portraying them more realistically, as a people, diverse, with rich history of both failures and successes. 

Until the media can be more fair, I won't watch shows or read books that support this lazy thinking. This is how racism begins, and I won't be any part of it!

In my opinion, has had a beneficial impact on dating, with some provisos.    think it has made it easier to meet people, especially if you are shy or introverted., or you are in a situation where it is difficult to meet people, due to working hours, or family commitments.   Another positive is that it has opened up a far broader range of people to meet, rather than just those you work with or meet in social situations.   It has also made it easier to communicate with people, and to get to know them before you meet them.  You have now, usually, been pre matched with people that are similar to you, with shared interests and views.   This can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing.  There are those that just use the apps for causal relationships when others are looking for something more permanent.   There are also those that use the apps to find a partner for a one night stand.  The pre sorting also means that you might not get to experience people from varied backgrounds.  People also judge others on appearance on the apps, making spur of the moment decisions on someone's appearance, rather than getting to know the true person and developing a relationship that way.   I think that the apps have also made it easier for people to be dishonest, and to lie about their age, or their appearance.  However, there have always been some issues with dating, and the benefits for those looking to find a partner far outweigh the negatives.

In my opinion, technology worsens dating situations. People have more opportunities to be deceitful and dishonest when they are not initially meeting people in person. I think that if people were forced to meet in person, they would be more likely to be honest and upfront about their intentions. When people initially fill out their dating profiles, they are more likely to exaggerate or just blatantly lie.   think that technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 When people present themselves in a way that is dishonest, then any relationship will start out negatively and there is no way to gain a healthy relationship when it begins this way. When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. 
n my opinion, technology has made it easier for people to be dishonest and deceitful.
 It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future. When a relationship begins as a result of an online dating site, be prepared for lies, disappointment and an unrealistic outcome that is most likely not as described.

So when Matt comes back into her life again without her realizing his identity, she is relieved to find that she is capable of finding love again. It's too bad though because Matt is still seeing other women on the side, and this time he's seeing Soeurette's younger sister, Virginia.  When Soeurette finds this out she again throws Matt out. But Matt quickly finds his way back to her and tells her he's committed for life. Soeurette believes him again and for whatever reason, this time Matt actually does hold true to his word. So, Matt and Soeurette end up living the rest of their lives together, but it's a little uncomfortable because underneath their relationship is always the tension that Matt had habitually cheated on Soeurette for so much of their relationship, and that Soeurette had always been too idiotic to notice. So, this story's moral is that people should always go into relationships with their eyes wide open. ",20,2,9,0,9,14,9,5,0,9,0.0,0.45,0.45,0.4476744186046512

The story follows a group of soldiers as they try to find out what happened to the other nations of the world.
 It seems that the other countries stayed in contact with one another. They formed a world government and are now trying to take over the United States. Apparently this had been the goal all along. When the soldiers uncovered this information, they wondered what they should do next. One soldier named George suggested working with the world government, in order to negotiate their continued freedom. The others, however, were not so sure. he sltherfsoldiers were ormer prisoners of war and were still very bitter about the treatment they received while in captivity.
 They didn't want to kindly negotiate their freedom. ""Lets blow up the World Capital,"" said another soldier named Ted. ""We'll show them what we think of their world government."" So the majority ruled over the decision and instead of calmly negotiating like George wanted, they decided to use violence. 

he group of soldiers then went to the World Capital and blew it up.
 This started a war between the United States and the World Government. Since the World Government was so much larger than the United States at this point, they won the war and took control over the United States. Violence didn't help them win, and they should have listened to George, who wanted to work together. The moral of the story is to think before you act, like George would have done.

 This power has been unknown for so long, people really don't know what to do with it. Some have fear that the Earth will end up like Ragnarok when Hella came back, but there are a quiet few who know better. This small group have been studying Mana for generations, passing the secrets of the ancient powers down through their family. Before the world went to pot,  the Keepers of Mana were able to skype and communicate via messenger and social media. They learned the magic spells and ways and kept written journals of what they discovered. This small group knew the time was coming when this power would be needed, and the had to be sure they were ready.

ow, they are ready to share the secrets of the Keepers of Mana with the world.
 There are so few people left, it won't be difficult to pass along what they know. Incredibly enough, each area where humanity survived a Keeper, or more, survived as well.  The Keepers had learned so much in their studies, they are able to communicate with each other via telepathy. They do so, and share what they are teaching to others. The time is coming when the Earth will be ready to battle the aliens that have taken over their loved home. To these few people, this is all too much like a scene from Avengers, and the aliens are no more than a Thanos that needs to be reckoned with.
TWhen the time is ready to do battle, it will be silently fought and the invaders won't know what is coming. Mana is magic that isn't showy or ostentatious. It is subtle and the Keepers and their students will strike without warning. The power comes from being of one mind and fighting for one cause. Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens. When the Earth was over populated, Mana struggled to survive because humans were always at odds with each other. Political battles, gender battles, income battles. All of the hatred humans had for one another, kept Mana silent and not of much use. Now that humans collectively are fighting to rid their world of the aliens, the power they hold is insurmountable. They will win this war. 

The day finally arrives when everyone on Earth has been taught the basic principals of the old magic. When all people are ready to be better and do better with the new world they are about to obtain.

Matt is totally uninterested in Soeurette's advances and keeps telling her to let him go, but Soeurette is delusional and thinks that Matt is in love with her and is just playing hard to get. 
Soeurette is a very determined alien, and she is not going to give up on her love for Matt.
 She has been trying to convince Matt to marry her for a long time, and she is not going to give up on him that easily. She finally decides to tell him that she is pregnant to force Matt's hand at marriage. Matt is shocked by this, but he is even more shocked when he finds out that Soeurette is actually pregnant -- since she could have been lying. He is even more shocked when he finds out that he is the father of the child. 
Matt is not ready to be a father, and he is not ready to be married.
 He has no idea how he could be the father of this child, since he has never slept with Soeurette. In fact, he has never even kissed her. So how could he possibly be the father of her child? It doesn't make sense. In fact, Matt is convinced that Soeurette is lying to him. This is when Matt decides to deploy forces from planet Earth to help save him. He knows that people on Earth have been looking for him relentlessly; they just don't know which planet he is on now. Matt sends a radio signal to planet Earth to let everyone know that he needs to be rescued immediately from Soeurette's planet, which is named ""Zorba"". Immediately, human forces are mobilized and a rescue platoon is sent into space to bring Matt back to Earth. Soeurette, of course, is not going to let Matt go without a fight.

When the platoon arrives on planet Zorba, Matt immediately hops in with the rescue team. Soeurette pleads with him to stay, but Matt is determined to get back to Earth. He has no desire to stay on Zorba with Soeurette, who he deems to be truly crazy and in need of psychological help and therapy. As a result, Matt gets back to planet Earth and is happy to be rid of Soeurette. Meanwhile, Soeurette is heartbroken and feels like Matt has abandoned her. She has no idea who the father of her baby is because she has been with quite a few guys at this point, and she has no idea which one of them is the father of her baby.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the book. They both have their pros and cons though. For example, reading a book will help you sharpen your reading skills, help some people drift off to sleep, and allow your own mind to paint the pictures and assign voices to the characters in the book. Audiobooks have the benefits of allowing you to do anything you want while enjoying a full length book.

I prefer to listen to audiobooks. The reasons for that are a few things really. I can already read at a high level of English. I also don't like the drowsy feeling I get from sitting and reading a book. I also like how I can listen to an audiobook almost anywhere, while doing almost anything like driving somewhere, taking a showing, preparing a meal, grocery shopping, and many other things. My favorite is audiobook also because I can paint the picture in my mind with little effort, just like reading and I can focus on whatever I am doing at the moment at the same time. I also used to listen to audiobooks while I was working, and that really helped the time go by quickly.
If someone was to compare an audiobook to reading a book I would say the audiobook is better.
 Some of the audiobooks I have listened to also provide excellent entertainment value. A perfect example (sorry for being nerdy) is the Harry Potter audiobooks, where the narrator reads each characters lines in a different voice.

It is a power of creation.  As the  numbers of humans left alive dwindle,  the old effects of Mana have begun to return, and the ability to wield powers has begun to re-kindle in some individuals . But the process is too slow help humanity as a whole.  So to accelerate the process, a group of survivors have begun to experiment with ways of artificially accelerating the growth of Mana.

They hit upon an ingenious stratagem: in order to grow stronger, they need to expose a single human to all the world's mana, and tap into the energy of that single human soul. They develop a chamber made of a material that can contain mana, and a brave individual volunteers to remain inside.  his chamber is called the Transference Chamber.
 The volunteer who will receive all the mana, will be known as the Conduit.

So as alien bombardment continues, and the situation growing increasingly perilous, mana flows into the Transference Chamber, and the Conduit absorbs it. The effects are rapid. The Conduit rapidly begins to evolve, becoming a Mana user capable of superhuman feats of magic.

The kidnapping wasn't motived by profit or a desire to possess, it turns out that the alien is a huge fan of Matt Damon, and was simply too shy to introduce himself.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotype is the ""dumb blonde"" or ""dumb brunette."" I have seen this stereotype in many movies and television shows. The character is usually a female and she is portrayed as being unintelligent. She is usually a cheerleader or a popular girl. Her lack of experience in math, the sciences is used as a punchline, her only worth her stereotypically beautiful body.

I think that the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype is offensive because it makes people think that they are not as smart as other people, while only using one metric of intelligence.  Social intelligence is real, and the traditional IQ is only one manner of gauging someone's intelligence.
 There's many ways people can be intelligent, and bullying them for not being smart on a particular subject does not encourage them to learn. 
IPeople are smart in their own ways. I have seen many people who are not the smartest in school, but they are very intelligent in other ways. They are very good at sports or art. They can be amazing at dealing with other people. They are good at taking care of their families. They are good at being a friend. Intelligence does not equal worth.  People can make real and valuable contributions even if they don't understand advanced calculus. 
I would not watch or read something that has a ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in it.
 I would not want to support a movie or book that makes fun of people who are not the smartest in school. Instead, we should encourage people who are not good at a subject, to work harder and try to be better at it.

This was the 4th time they dated, but all of the other times they had crashed and burned after less than 8 months. So he was certain that this was the right face.   He had it all planned out. He bought a ring, made the dinner reservations, and rented out the observation deck of her favorite city viewing spot. 

It was hard being a shapeshifter. Once you started changing, even just once, there was so much to keep track of, and so much work to do to create a new ""you"". It was a lot of work to keep track of all the details of your life, and to make sure that you didn't leave any evidence of your past, while still maintaining a legal identity. Not that his current one was technically ""legal"". He had been born in a small town in the Midwest, and had been a ""normal"" guy until he had been in a car accident. They had expected horrible scarring, and were surprised there was none. But he didn't look like he had either. In fact, he suddenly grew 3 inches, and looked and awful like the popular actor of the time, the one all the girls in his class had been gushing over. At first he thought he had the best luck, but then he realized the changes just freaked every one out. He was a freak, and he had to leave town. One day a woman he was interested in told him she preferred brunettes. When he woke up the next morning his hair color was different, and there were changes to his face. And that's when he knew. He could control this.

Which came in handy when he met Valarie. They dated for about 3 months the first time, then she broke up with him when he flirted with another woman. He realized his mistake, but she just wouldn't take him back. So he changed. He wasn't really certain why the other times he dated her didn't work out. Maybe it was the fact that he was a bit of a playboy, and she wasn't. He didn't cheat, but who doesn't like attention? But this time, it seemed like she accepted him for what he was, and this time he was going to get to marry her.

Dinner was strangely tense, which he had not been expected. He asked about her day, but all she would say was that she had an extra long session with her therapist, and they could talk about it later. He thought that was weird, but they were in a restaurant; maybe she didn't want to get emotional there? He had been looking forward to this night for a long time, and he was determined to make it special.

They went to the observation deck, and if anything the atmosphere got even more intense. She was acting like she was mad at him, and he was starting to get frustrated. He was about to tell her she was ruining the moment, when she turned to him. ""I've been talking to my therapist for months now about my past relationships.

He recoiled in shock, suddenly fearful. No one could know his secret, not even her, it was too dangerous. SHe looked away from him, holding the railing as she looked out over the city. He didn't want to do it, but he had to. He got ready to push her.

""Well, not literally you, but your type. And it just isn't good for me. So, I'm sorry, but this is goodbye.""

He stopped just before pushing her, relieved for a moment. Then angry again, fists clenched, just what did he have to be to keep her? He was about to push her, when he felt a hand on his shoulder. 

""You're a good man and you deserve better. I'm going to leave and start a new life somewhere else, a whole new me. I wish the best for you.""

And with that he finally felt shame. He was the one who had been deceiving her, and she called him a good man. He let her go, and decided that this was it.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, while yes engaging with the news and current events helps us keep up on the world, it does not by any means make us bad citizens if we don't. I think it is okay to take a break of news sometimes. Often times we just hear about all the bad things going on in the world, or our country. More than likely, like myself, people get sick and tired of hearing all the violence and terrorism around the world and just want to tune out and not dwell on it, and focus on the positives in their life.

It's almost impossible to not know what's in the news this day and age anyways, due to word of mouth and stuff like that. You always have a friend or family member telling people what they had in the news anyways. The same goes with social media. All throughout social media you see stuff about the news, and people will not hesitate to share it with their followers. So it's hard to avoid. But who can blame a person for wanting to tune out all the negative news and hear something good in their life anyways. 
Do I believe there is a responsibility to know what is going on in the world?
 No, I do not. I feel there are plenty of other people out there who do enough worrying about everything. I feel you should save your energy from worrying, and use it to purify your soul and become a better person. If more people did that, maybe they would become better citizens, who knows. 

Even more so, many people only focus on specific types of news anyways and tune everything else out. I'm sure they feel they are not bad people. 
Maybe they dealize that tuning out some news would greatly help them escape from some of their worries and lessen stress on their lives.
 I have kids, and I know they don't even care about the news one little bit, unless it has something to do with video games of course. Just like all the other normal kids. i don't think they are bad citizens. Many old folks do the same.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. I think that the amount of money that they bring in for their schools is enough to pay them. The NCAA is a non-profit organization that makes billions of dollars off of college athletics. The NCAA is a monopoly that has no competition.

Even if athletes received a small stipend, it would not hurt the NCAA. The NCAA would still make billions of dollars off of college athletics.
Schools would bid for top athletes and increase competition.  Athletes would realize their options in a free market. They could go anywhere, do anything with the school of their choice. 

Television networks also make millions off college athletics. College athletes deserve to be paid because they are the ones that bring in the money. They should be allowed to make endorsement deals and do advertisements. 

Schools benefit from athletes' contributions. Very often, the sports program generates the most money and positive attention for the school.  Athletes should be able to benefit from their hard work and contributions to the sports programs. 

ollege athletes deserve to be paid because they bring in millions of dollars for their schools., on television, and NCAA franchising

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important purpose of school is not to learn concrete things (though this is definitely important, as well) but rather to learn how to learn.   I think that the most important thing I have learned in school is how to learn, even though I didn't really know it at the time, and this skill has stayed with me throughout my life.  If I had applied myself more strongly in school, I would probably be doing much better.

There is a common argument than in the internet age, people don't really need to learn facts, because we can easily find the answers to questions.  However, I think this idea is misguided.  School is necessary to teach students a foundation of knowledge, so that they can know what questions they need to be asking.  For this reason, knowing basic mathematics, and also the fundamentals of grammar, history, the scientific method, and the humanities are vitally important for everyone.  

Someone can easily find out what year the Battle of Hastings took place, but without attending school and paying sufficient attention, they wouldn't know that such a thing was important, nor would they have any idea why it was a topic of discussion.  I think that by learning how to learn, I can continue to expand my own breadth of knowledge, and to deal with unexpected new problems, simply because I recognize facts and techniques that I had used before.  Obviously, no one can remember everything, but a good education can remind us of what we need to know, and thus, make it easy to figure it out again.  

However, I also think that there are some very important subjects that are not being taught in school, and I wish that I had learned these things when I was young.  
WSome of he most important things sthat tudents should learn in school?, include media literacy and skeptical thinking.  Kids (and adults) need to learn how to evaluate claims that are made by pundits, by journalists, and by advertisers.  Many of the current problems our country faces would be alleviated if people had simply gained the ability to recognize when they are being lied to.  

Another important topic that should be taught in school is personal finance, accounting, and law.  Students leave school without enough practical knowledge, and oftentimes, their parents lack this knowledge as well.  As I said before, a child with a good fundamental education can teach him or herself how to deal with practical problems in life, but it would be much easier if they were taught this kind of thing in school.  If I had my way, ""Home Economics"" would be brought back and taught every year, and it would teach students about all the practical issues they will face at home, including economics, maintenance, car repair, budgeting, and so on.  

Alas, I am starting to get off topic, so I will return to my main point.  The most important thing you can learn in school is how to learn.  If you know the basics of the research process, and also know enough basic facts to recognize how complicated most problems are, you can probably figure out the rest for yourself.  I think it took me well into my college years to be able to say that I finally understood these things, and sadly, many students will not have that same opportunity.  And that is why I think that schools should concentrate on fundamentals, but also on pragmatics.  

I hope that future generations will be taught how to teach themselves to deal with unique problems, but I also hope that they will be taught exactly how to deal with the most common problems.",29,6,21,0,2,6,2,4,2,0,0.0,0.7241379310344828,0.06896551724137931,0.42097488921713444

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading it without a doubt. I think there are many advantages to listening to an audio book in my personal opinion. Sometimes the reader's voice even ties into the book, and makes the book feel even more real. For example, if you listen to a harry potter book using audible, the voice matches that of the characters in harry potter. Its that british sounding voice. In addition to this, you are able to listen to the book in many more situations and places than you would be able to physically read a book. I can lay down in bed without having to sit up and listen to a book, or listen to a book while driving, or while cleaning up in the house, or even while taking the dogs for a walk. This makes it much easier to indulge yourself into a good book. I personally do not feel that there are any advantages to reading a book physically over listening. I think it is simply preference. Reading is more quiet and can allow some people the ability to immerse themselves a little more. However, i dont really find reading to have any advantages like audiobooks do, especially for efficiency. I am a huge fan of being efficient, and being able to listen while still working or doing other activities is the seller for me. You may even save money using an audiobook, as normally these are subscriptions and you can get titles for cheaper. I pay a monthly fee for a certain number of credits for my subscription, and normally one credit is the equivalent of one book. The monthly fee is only 15 dollars a month, so do the math on that. If your heavy into books, this is well worth it, not only for the books but for the service. I personally am a huge fan of audible, i love the ability to be able to download and listen to my books at my own steps. Audible is an app that you can download where there are many audiobooks available at your disposal. Audible is associated with amazon, and i have an amazon prime so this was a no brainer for me. I believe you even get free credits simply because you are a prime member as well. Dont know the exact number on this however. These are all reasons why i feel using audiobooks have so many advantages. Just grab a pair of headphones and listen on the go. Search the library for whatever books you may be interested in, and even find books out that you may be interested in. There is a rating system just like amazon has on their main site, and this allows you to know what other people think of the book.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology is not a very good way to enhance dating. I myself have not used it. I think in order to know if there is an initial attraction, I need to first meet someone in person. That way I can see their actual personality, react to their facial expressions and hand gestures, and just immediately feel if there is a connection or not. With apps that use online dating, too much time may be wasted on someone that is not a good match. And there is also the possibility to be catfished, which can be a terrible experience for someone. And then there is also the shallowness factor. When dating online, people are mainly judging someone by the way their photo looks. This can be deceiving. It can also be unfair or frustrating for someone who may be great but doesn't look very attractive in photos. 

I also think that getting to know someone over technology just isn't the same as talking to them in person. Over text or on social media, we are limited in what we can convey and what we can hear from that person. It's really hard to get a good feel of someone's sense of humor this way. People tend to be more dorky or boring or awkward over technology than they are in person. I know I don't like texting, so I don't sound very interesting at all in a chat or text. It's also really hard to convey someone's tone and meaning communicating this way.
I think technology is great for keeping in touch with someone you already know and love.

In my opinion, paying college athletes is a good idea. The only problem i think would be the star players earning more money than the other players. As the prompt states, i think this would cause a bidding type of war. Basically, the schools with the most money would end up ruling the league. I think a better alternative would be a stipend or something like that so college players would be able to live comfortably and not have to worry about any sort of expenses during the school year. There is no need for the athletes to be paid like professionals, however they should be granted some sort of money just because of the impact they are making for the school financially. There are stories of college athletes who cant even afford food during the stay in college. This is unacceptable due to all they do for the university.

Another possible issue that may come with paying NCAA athletes would be the fact that some schools have a lot more money than other schools. This would make it difficult for the NCAA to issue any league wide policy for athletes. I think it would turn into some sort of percentage, and this would still cause a big difference in the amount of money athletes make from school to school. So in a way, the bidding process would still be a thing. Maybe having a cap would be a good way to work around this idea if equality was what they were shooting for in the NCAA. Either way, there seems to be drawbacks for each type of method chosen. In conclusion, i still feel that NCAA athletes should be paid some sort of money.

She loves it, and all the freedoms she has here since she came from what we would consider a 3rd world country. All that was possible through technology, and using it for dating. 

It really is a great way to meet people. A long time ago also, I met my best friend through technology and a gaming form of social media named world of warcraft. that was ages ago though.

My whole point is there are great ways to meet people and have relationships using technology. Anyone who says otherwise is just really old fashion and not with the times, or has been really hurt by someone through the use of technology. Especially dating and social media apps. It's good if used properly. ",29,9,16,0,4,5,4,1,0,4,0.0,0.5517241379310345,0.13793103448275862,0.5142045454545454
885,547fa8cbc3294669b00903779ce63e9d.jsonl,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, I think that some people are more empathic towards the suffering of animals because most people have pets, and because of that they put into their imaginations that the suffering of an animal they see on TV, or where ever else, as though it could be happening to their pet. 

As far as tourists suffering goes, as a former tourist myself, people in a foreign land are interested in the tourist but do not really seem to care that much. Maybe even because of human prejudice. They do not see others who are not related to them in some way as inferior.

Many people forget that humans are animals also, so in a way humans can fall under animal suffering as well. So yes, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare while ignoring human welfare.
I think that people should focus on both to be honest. It is wrong to treat an animal badly, but it is also just as wrong to treat a person badly also. Animals and Humans are living things and to abuse them in any way is a bad thing. 

Some people focus on animal welfare also because it gives them a sense of being better than other, and they view it as humans fault that animals are suffering.",16,7,7,0,2,5,2,3,1,1,0.0,0.4375,0.125,0.4891640866873065

People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

People began doing things differently. Suddenly, just as suddenly as the Dad mugs had changed, food pantries filled with the best tasting foods. Shortly thereafter, a new policy came out of the Airbnb community. They would no longer be charging people who wish to stay in their extra houses. No more homelessness. Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

People were their same old selves, out in public. What had changed was what they did in the shadows. They were being their best selves, in the shadows. They were being as decent when they were alone, as they would tend to be out in public. That made a big enough difference to change the world.

A new holiday was declared, the world over. Mug day was to celebrate the day when everything changed. People prayed to the cosmic entity that had changed all the mugs. There was a new god in town, and his name was Mug. Mug the magnificent they called this new deity.

One day, a man looked at himself in the mirror. “I’m not the man I want to be. And I can't seem to keep the woman I love. What am I going to do?”

The thing was, he had a pretty good idea of what he needed to do, he just wasn't sure it was the right thing to do.
The man was a shapeshifter.
 And over the years he had used his abilities to change his identity several times - whenever he missed out on a big job because of a bad interview, when he had gotten in trouble with the law, and yes, even with women. But when he had met Kara he decided he needed to change. She was the first person who had given him confidence in a long time. And he was certain he wanted to be with her forever. But after a little while, she started to notice things about him that he had wanted to hide. And she seemed to pull away from him. And last night, she broke up with him and said she didn't want to see him any more, that he wasn't the man she thought he was when they met.
He didn't need to be a mind reader to know what was going on.
 She was right, he wasn't the man she thought he was. So now the choice, did he change his face and try to be the man she wanted, or just let her go.
He looked at himself in the mirror again, and he made his decision.
 Not that it was ever really in question. And his eyes changed color, he grew and inch, and dozens of other changes happened. And then he started planning.

The first time they met again was at the library. She was looking for a book, and he was looking for her. And they chatted, and hit it off, just like the last time. And again they started dating. And he told her about his plans for the future, and she listened, and seemed to like what he had in mind. But again, after about 6 months, she broke up with him, with the same ""You're not the man I thought you were.""

The next time, he went for a little less attractive, a little more cuddly. And it was at the supermarket they met. He really thought he had it that time, but after only a few months she started saying they should see other people. 
He was getting frustrated.
 And even angry at her. One more time - the most attractive form he had ever taken, with all of the right words and gifts and thoughtfulness. But this time, even after weeks of being nice and approaching her in all the right ways, she wouldn't even accept a date with her.

""Kara, why won't you go out with me,"" he cajoled. ""We'd be so perfect together!"" 

Kara looked at him from across the table in the coffee shop they were in. ""Chris, it's just...I don't know. I feel like I know you so well, and we share so many things, but it also feels completely wrong. I can't even imagine dating you."" She looked away, with an awkward expression. ""I'm sorry, but if you are  going to keep pushing, I don't think we should be friends.""

He stood up in a rage, finally losing all of his cool and caution. ""What do you mean by that. After all of these years and all of the work I've done to be perfect and you won't even listen to me!""

Kara was certain he was having a breakdown. Maybe that was why all of her internal warnings not to date him had been going off? ""Chris, calm down. I said I feel like I've known you forever, but it has only been a few weeks.,,""

Suddenly, as she looked at him, his face and body morphed. From one familiar form to another, until finally he became the man she had met years ago. The man she still loved, but wasn't sure he could trust. And now she knew why.

She stood up, and ran away. As he ran after her, he tripped and fell into the street. By the time he got up and out of the way of traffic she was gone. And, as his rage faded he knew that this time he needed to let her go. He thought of the terror and betrayal he had seen in her eyes the moment before she ran. It finally broke his heart.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

The kind of stereotypical characters in books, movies, or television shows that make me cringe would be the ones that are not fleshed out, and effectively perpetuate negative views that people hold in society towards certain groups of people. This includes stereotypical characters that are used to make fun of people, or to make them look bad based on their race, gender, sexuality, and other traits. I feel such characters are not only offensive to watch or read about, but they are also harmful to the people they are based on. I think many stereotypical characters are used as a justification for people to hold negative views towards certain groups of people, and I think that is very dangerous. Stereotypes often can coincide with prejudice and discrimination, both of which can also lead to horrible outcomes such as hate crimes. Thus, I do not really tolerate the presence of stereotypical characters in any media that I consume, even if the stereotypes they portray appear harmless or not as exaggerated as others that can persist in the modern world. 
I think that the most offensive stereotypical characters are those that are used to make fun of people, or tohat demeans them and shows them as inferior or unequal to other characters. I would definitely not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone, mostly because I can understand the harm and discomfort people can feel when they see stereotypes that are viewed as accurate depictions of themselves. I would rather spend my time engaging with content that I find more thought-provoking or even enjoyable, that don't rely on stereotypes in how it depicts the characters. I prefer that if people are going to create content, they should at least try to be more creative and thoughtful in how they portray characters, given how much that can help in lessening the prevalence of stereotypes in society, and help in the process of making others feel accepted for who they are. There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming more numerous and widespread. Thus I think it is important for myself and others to support such content, and to not watch or even critique content that portray people as negative stereotypes.",17,4,7,0,6,9,6,3,1,5,0.0,0.4117647058823529,0.35294117647058826,0.4129032258064516

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, both listening to audiobooks, and reading are are good, each offering benefits.  One method maybe be better than the other in a specific situation, but overall, each method contributes equally to education, learning, and entertainment in its own unique fashion.
I listen to audiobooks when I'm doing something else, like driving, walking, or working out.
   I find it easier to listen to a book than read it, because I can do something else at the same time. I don't have to concentrate on reading, and I can listen to the book in the background. 

Audiobooks are great when your hands are preoccupied, situations where you couldn't hold or read a traditional book.   I have listened to audiobooks while doing dishes, cleaning, and even working out.  Audiobooks while cooking and commuting to work are part of my daily routine. 

Audiobooks also can be used by children who cannot read the traditional books yet, or the visually impaired.   Audiobooks are also great for people who are learning a second language.

Traditional book reading though, has its own place in my heart.   I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. 

Relaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. 

I love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.   I  love the ability to read a book in bed, and not have to worry about falling asleep with my headphones on, crushing a screen, or charging a battery. 
I think both methods of reading have their place, and I enjoy both.

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a character is the ""magical negro.""  Yes, that is a real term, for a common trope. This is a character who is there to help the white protagonist, but has no real purpose in the story. They don't really have any character development. They're just there to help the white person, to be the ""other"" person.

They're the janitor or the black man who has just been in jail.  They're the girl next door with no personality of her own, who adores the protagonist for no good reason. They're the weird gay friend who lusts after the main character.

   don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" woman.
 I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" gay person. I don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" disabled person.  don't like it when a character is only there to be the ""token"" anything.
 

'm not saying that these characters can't be written well.
 I'm saying that when they are written well, they are not offensive.  It's the lazy writing, the way these characters exist only to help the white (often male) star of the show, and don't exist as people themselves.  It's the way they are only there to be the ""other"" person, watching the hero from the outside. 
I don't think I would ever natch or read something bshallow like this, ecause of its offensive portrayal of someone.
 I would rather read or watch something that is well-written and has a diverse cast of characters-they can be any color they want.

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid, but not any more than college students in other parts of faculty. There should be a limit on how much the athletes can be paid while enrolled in classes. However, I feel that they should be entitled to royalties on anything particularly made of themselves. The athletes should have to conform to some kind of code of conduct as to not do anything that would tarnish the positive effect they could have over the public. In addition, the coaches should have to follow a code of conduct as well. This means not doing anything that could be considered unethical including coercion of teachers to give the appropriate grades needed to fulfill academic requirements. College athletes should be protected from getting exploited much the same way child models are being protected, as well as their implications for their future job opportunities.

In my opinion, Ryan Reynolds is cringeworthy. I don't know the person, and the actor is good, but the characterization of Deadpool leaves me feeling physically ill. It's a product of modern Hollywood, which has learned that the way to make the most money is to create a gory superhero movie. People eat that up and that seems to be the direction of the mindset of the general population. The power to kill is the greatest power. It's a sad state of affairs.

There is very little variety in modern film, because companies who make big movies are using data to hit the widest audience possible. The widest audience that they feel they can reach is the segment of the population who loves action oriented sequences, featuring intense, gory violence. They like the killer to make little jokes about it, as they kill. This is causing an indoctrination of that mindset in children, who superheroes were originally targeting. 
I'm not saying that there is no place for this kind of film, but it's getting out of hand.
 Most big movies revolve around superheroes, supervillains and a lot of violence. Since adults are consuming this material, the movies are geared toward adults. Kids still love their superheroes, so they are watching too. 
I think that the over-saturation of this kind of material is causing a lot of people to become desensitized to violence.
 Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. 
I think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy.
 They are becoming desensitized to the suffering of others. I think that this is a very dangerous trend. Learning why killing is wrong has to be a cornerstone of childhood. Our society is going the other way. 
I'm not saying that we should ban violent movies, but I think that we should be more selective about what we allow our children to watch
 We can't do that when characters like Deadpool are enticing us with a cutesy personality, but a deadly disposition. It's confusing to adults, and dangerous for children.

The Moms, who have been watching this all happen, finally decide to step in and fix the problem. They form a council, the ""Moms of the World"" and begin to decide what to do. They decide that the dads are unlikely to stop fighting, so they decide to take drastic action. They round the dads up and capture them. This is surprisingly easy, as the dads are so busy fighting that they don't notice the moms coming. They imprison them, while they try to brainstorm a solution to the problem. Finally, they settle on a tournament, a ""Dad-Off"" to determine who are the good dads, and who are the bad dads. They get the dads to agree to accept the results of the tournament, as final, and an end to the best dad dispute, and they begin to set it up.

It will be a battle to the death. The top 50% of the dads will be allowed to live, and the bottom 50%, if they fail to be killed in combat, will be executed. The moms and kids, having grown somewhat sadistic by this time, create a series of brutal combat arenas, and the tournament begins. They also take bets on who will win, and the betting is quite heavy, with the top-ranked dads being natural odds favorites, and the lower-ranked dads 

The tournament goes on for a very long time, and the moms and kids have a lot of sick fun watching the dads fight each other. But, something unexpected is observed during the betting. The dads who are ranked higher are not winning. The lower ranked dads are consistently winning. The betting odds gradually change to reflect this.

The tournament continues, and the lower-ranked dads continue to win. The #1 Dad, who managed to get past the first round, falls in the second, and by the third round, no dads ranked in the top 25% are left. After perhaps the bloodiest year in human history, the tournament is finally over.

The winners are freed, to start new families, and the losers are executed. There is some speculation about the mugs, and the rankings. It is suggested that the mugs were rigged, and that the rankings were false, because the results of the tournament, are the reverse of what they mugs had claimed.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sports needs to be carefully monitored for certain negative outcomes associated with that particular sport. This way the athletes can make the rational decision whether to pursue that particular sport or not. My stance on the acceptability of extreme sports and whether they should be banned in some cases is to let them continue for now until more research is done. like with football and CTE, new information has emerged about the long term impact of playing full contact football and the extent of that damage. Its has encouraged early retirements across the league. I think MMA is about as extreme of a sport as there is. This one should be closely monitored for conditions like CTE and a whole host of other issues from getting hit in other places not just during their fights but during practice. It is literally their job to get beaten up. I would assume that we will see significant long term damage to these fighters, worse then what we see with older boxers. It is still their right to fight as long as it legally sanctioned. I cant stress this enough though, while I think extreme sports should be left up to the decisions of the athletes, I also think they should be given all the relevant data that goes along with their desired field. I think this is a vital part in the decision making process of each individual but as I said before, it is still up to the individual.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The little pig saw the wolf and said ""Anders, don't you dare try to come in!"" Anders was surprised by the little pig's hostility. He was a friendly wolf and had no intentions of harming the little pig. He just wanted to be friends. Anders asked the little pig if the little pig would be interested in a sleepover, but the little pig would have none of it. ""I'm smarter than that,"" the little pig scoffed. ""There's no way you're getting in here."" Anders was sad. He didn't have many friends. He knew that many animals despised wolves, but he didn't understand why. Anders didn't have a mean bone in his body. He was a gentle wolf. So he was determined to make friends with the little wolf and prove to the little pig that he was a good wolf. He dropped by the next day and offered the little pig a gift. The gift was a tin full of cookies and treats. The little pig was surprised by the gift. However, he was not swayed by the wolf's generosity. He was immediately suspicious that the wolf must have an ulterior motive. ""There is no ulterior motive,"" Anders protested, but the little pig was not convinced. Anders began to describe the treats that were in the tin: ""Look,"" he said. ""I've brought you some homemade lemon bars, some chocolate chip cookies, some brownies, some chocolate covered strawberries, some chocolate covered bananas, some chocolate covered cherries, some chocolate covered blueberries... who doesn't like these treats?"" The little pig was intrigued. He was always a sucker for good dessert. Even if Anders was a wolf, it was a nice gesture for him to bring desserts. So the little wolf agreed to meet Anders and share the treats, though the little pig insisted that they meet outside of the house. ""We can meet in my backyard,"" the little pig said. He was going to take every precaution with this wolf. Anders relented. He could make friends with the pig regardless of the location, even if the little pig wasn't being totally hospitable. So they met in the backyard. The little pig was surprised to see that the wolf had also brought a whole picnic basket full of delicacies, including cheese sandwiches, cold fried chicken, potato salad, egg salad, potato chips, and chocolate cake. Not only that, but the basket also had a bottle of wine and a bottle of champagne. ""Wow,"" the little pig said. ""You really went all out."" The two animals snacked and wined and dined on the food that Anders had brought. The little pig was very impressed. He realized that Anders was actually a very good conversation partner. He was well-read and had a lot of interesting things to say. He was also very funny. The little pig was having a great time. ""I'm so glad that I decided to meet you,"" the little pig said. ""I had no idea that you were such a great guy."" Anders nodded. ""I'm sorry that some wolves have a bad reputation,"" he said. ""But I promise I just want to be friends. Maybe we could hang out again sometime."" The little pig smiled. ""I'd like that,"" he said. After all, he could use a friend or two, and regardless it would be good to be friends with a wolf so Anders could scare away any mean, bad wolves that might come around. The two animals exchanged phone numbers and parted ways. But from then on, they stayed in close touch with each other and became lifelong friends. The moral of the story is that you should always be open and receptive to kindness! You never know when that might lead to an unexpected friendship.

All you're doing is reading the paper and drinking coffee, and suddenly your mug changes to show that you're actually the #1 Dad. You feel pride well up inside you, but then you feel a sense of shock. That's because you inherited this mug from your own dad, who didn't feel like bringing it with him when he packed up and moved to another state with his new girlfriend. You don't have a #1 Dad mug of your own because you are not a dad. You are a single man in his mid-30s who lives alone in the same house he grew up in. You don't even have a dog. You have a cat, but you're not sure if it counts. 
You're not sure how to feel about this.
 How could you be a father? You start racking your brain. Did you have a kid when you were in college and forget about it? Did you have a kid with a girl you dated for a couple of months in high school? What was her name again? You think harder. You remember her name was Soeurette Morley. That's right. The two of you had spent one steamy night together, where you both got so drunk you couldn't remember anything. You were both virgins, and you were both so nervous that you didn't even know what to do. You had a condom, but you were both so nervous that you didn't even use it. You both woke up the next morning and were horrified to discover that you had done it. But you were both so drunk that you couldn't remember anything, and regardless, she promised that she was on the pill.

Well, now you're stunned. If you're the #1 Dad in the world, then you must have gotten Soeurette pregnant. You decide to give her a call. She answers the phone, and you say, ""Soeurette, I have to ask you something. Did we have a baby together?"" Soeurette laughs and asks you what you're talking about. You tell her you're the #1 Dad in the world, according to the mug in your hand, and you're pretty sure that you had a baby with her, because you can't think of any other explanation. After all, you haven't slept with anyone else since then, and you haven't been a father before. Soeurette suddenly grows quiet. She admits that she has a seven-year old daughter , and that she's been keeping her a secret from you. She says she knew that you had plans for college and that she didn't want her pregnancy to keep you from achieving your goals. You are stunned and ask her how you can meet your daughter. Soeurette says that you can come over to meet her now. You ask for her name and Soeurette says she named your daughter Harper. 
You arrive at Soeurette's house and knock on the door.
 Harper answers the door and you meet her for the first time. Your eyes well up with pride when you see her. Soeurette is standing behind her, and she says, ""Harper, this is your father."" Harper asks if you want to take her out for ice cream and you agree. You take her to the ice cream parlor and she orders a chocolate cone. Over ice cream, the two of you start bonding and you realize Harper is a pretty decent kid. From then on, you start building a relationship with your daughter and get to know Harper quite well, making up for lost time.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, no, we are not being bad citizens by not watching the news.  People surely have a responsibility to pay attention to their community and to what's going on around them, but this can be done without watching world news or interacting with technology in any way. Just paying attention to what's going on in our environment will do just fine. 

I feel that the news outlets these days vary so much in their interpretation that this whole idea of ""news"" has become more and more warped. It's also really hard to separate the information from the commentary about it on some outlets. Surely avoiding this charade does not make someone a bad citizen. aying attention and being connected to our communities alone will do a lot to keep our citizens informed.
 But watching all of the negative commentary embedded within the news can actually hurt communities by deepening an already existing political divide. 

Engaging with current event can be more helpful on a local level, for example if you are helping feed people in your community because of a tragedy. This, also, can be done simply by paying attention and does not have to involve consuming the news. 

All in all, I'd say people shouldn't be worried about not keeping up with the news. There seem to be more bad effects from it than good and there are other ways to stay informed. So, no.

You were the result of this union, and the queen had taken her anger out on you. The queen, your ""mother"", who also took human form in order to punish the King for his unfaithfulness.

So you had been waiting, for years, to hear from the bees. And the bee that finally reached you told you the rest of the story.

The bees loyal to your father had been trying to get you to safety so that they could release your father from an enchantment, but every time they tried he would lose his memory of you and forget to watch out for you. And so they always failed to reach you.

The bee on your shoulder told you to hold out your hand.
 When he landed on it he told you to concentrate on him, and what it would be like to be a bee. And suddenly you were! Now you were truly ready to take back the kingdom.

It was a long drawn out battle, with great feats. near losses, last minute triumph. And at the end, you stood triumphant in front of your father, who was still trapped by the queen's spell. You spoke the words to break the spell, and saw recognition and joy in his eyes. hovered in front of you, and with a cry proclaimed ""All Hail the true Bee King!""

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Technology has made dating better. A much larger pool of candidates are available, with algorithms scanning our profile date to help us find the perfect match. Technologyahas lso made dating worse.
 It's easier to be rude and inconsiderate, and it's easier to be dishonest. 
It is purely a tool, that accentuates the good and bad parts of each of us. It allows us to be more of ourselves, for better or for worse.  

Some dating apps have been great, making connections with great people with similar interests. Some have been terrible, connecting me with people who are ""verified"", but nothing like their profile, with nothing in common. 

Social media and the plethora of new streaming sites with dating shows has given us insight, and has given us unrealistic perceptions. 
It has fake people faking relations for superficial reasons. It has been the way some people have found true love in remote rural areas. 

There's sex toys, dolls,  virtual reality that remove any need for human interaction, destroying the basis for human relationships.

It causes those who took the drug to become mindless zombies. You and your friends now have to survive as the earth is being overrun by these zombies.

It's not a smooth journey. Your group is people who are close to 90 years old trying to evade zombies. Each attack kills a big chunk of the group as they are too weak to fight and too slow to run. So, how do you survive? How do you get your group to safety? I decide to lead the survivors to an island. On the way to the island, we come across a couple of villages that have survived and are willing to help us. They share supplies and give us a place to rest.

 We'll live together on the island and just avoid each other. We realize we don't have much time left to live anyway so we may as well not spend our last days fighting. The zombies would enjoy watching it too much. ",32,3,22,0,7,10,7,3,0,7,0.0,0.6875,0.21875,0.56951871657754

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, characters who are young and in love are often over generalized too much.  People are unique and handle relationship issues differently. MUST every young straight couple be Thin and beautiful. Can't one of the couple be thin, and the other normal? Or someone heavy with someone thin. I like contrast and the story would be richer with more contrasts instead of homogenizing everything so.
How about this, to avoid cringing; have someone, of similar age, but different educational and physical ability in love with someone who is able bodied? We never see such things, yet they exist? Why can't we see real things that represent real America?

I also cringe when people kiss constantly, and just walk hand in hand? When people do such things in real life, it's a spectacle. Why do such cringeworthy things gain acceptance on TV? 
I also cringe when people are so beautiful, and have perfect skin, and perfect teeth.
 Few people of normal life are this way. What about people who are too poor to afford plastic surgery, or the latest spa treatments. Also, what is the deal with Waxing, and spas? I think with Covid few people do these things. Why not portray folks in covid  times as ungroomed (at least professionally?).  I often change the channel if there is too much model like perfection.  It's so hard to feel sorry for a character when they are perfect in appearance, no flaws. Please, I don't really care if they can't afford the latest edition of the I Phone. Really, I don't. 

I'm curious about how normal people live. Here's what I think a producer should do, to avoid some of these cringeworthy things. FORGET about casting the latest model thin actor/actress. Try for once to cast someone who is an actual Theater geek in high school college, just a normal young or old person who has talents but lives a life being overlooked. Make that person an actual star, in many ways, a sort of cinderella in real life story. Allow them to explain how things have changed in their life as a PART of the show, make it interesting and show us all the bits.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we all do have a responsibility to keep up with what is going on. I think lack of knowledge leads to ignorance and the inability to make reasonable arguments and rationale choices based on facts. The most recent presidential election and the situation in Afghanistan are two news items I can use as examples. Keeping up with the news is not only important for local and national events, but also in a global sense.

he most recent presidential election is a good example of how lack of knowledge can lead to poor choices.
  There were already so many lies being propagated by the Republican party, and Trump in particular, that those who did not keep up with current events were in more in the dark. I think it was imperative for everyone to understand what the issues facing the country were, how each candidate was going to solve those issues, and the lies each candidate may or may not have told.  Too many people simply chose ignorance of the aforementioned and voted along party lines. I think people are obligated to understand what really goes on in their country, and the best way to do that is to keep up with the news. Whether on TV, the radio, or online, there are multiple avenues to get news. It is up to the individual to seek it out, but the news is there.

World events also have an effect on our country. They can impact trade, safety, and immigration issues. Unless each person has family members in foreign nations, the news is the simplest way to see what is happening. Again, it is a deterrent of ignorance.  I personally have been so tired of hearing about COVID, I haven't watched the news for weeks.  A couple of days ago, my daughter asked me to explain why the situation in Afghanistan was happening, and I didn't even know what she was talking about. Ignorance isn't bliss, it is ignorance. To be educated, and to educate our children on events, we all need to watch the news.  Informed people make better informed choices and don't perpetuate lies about the world and life.
I think the news is important, but Iin that respect, you can't think the news is fake. These people went to college and worked hard for their degrees and to have journalistic integrity. To say they are basically liars, is cruel and bullying. We cannot allow that type of language to continue without being checked immediately if we are to be certain people believe what they hear or read in the news.

918,aec86c4e50874219b34fc6bbebe815de.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to engage in extreme sports, so long as the risk is only to one's self.   What is selfish is to inflict the risk on someone else, like your family, friends or even innocent bystanders.  However, this is extremely rare in the case of what I generally think of as ""extreme sports"", and is perhaps much more common in more traditional team sports or, especially, in auto racing.  

There is, of course, the question of whether or not this risk is acceptable, even in rare cases, but I would argue that spectators at auto races, and especially those who crowd around the dirt tracks at rally events, knowingly and willingly take on that risk.
IBack to the question at hand,  believe much of the danger is a result of what participants want from extreme sports.
  Most of what I think of as extreme sports are a contest in which an individual pushes his or her own personal limits.  This could be on a skateboard in a stunt park, or on the side of a remote mountain.  In these cases, they are really only risking their own life and limb, and as long as they are prepared to pay the consequences, they should be allowed to do so.  
However, it becomes selfish to the point of being dangerous when such risk forces others, who might not know better or be aware of the risks
 to pay some of the ultimate cost.  If an extreme athlete is uninsured, or has publicly provided health insurance, he or she is passing on the cost of any potential injury to the broader community.  You could make the case that even a fully-insured athlete is using hospital resources that might be better applied elsewhere, but I feel that this is not really salient.  If one were to take this position, we would have to consider children selfish every time they take a risk, and I am not willing to go that far.  It is the willful refusal (or inability) to pay for the consequences of one's actions that I consider to be selfish, and most extreme athletes do not engage in such conduct.  
However, I am not willing to completely dismiss the notion that some sports are too dangerous to be considered sporting events at all.
  One on one combat is a genre of sports that definitely comes close to, and sometimes crosses this line.  I would agree that athletes should be allowed to engage in boxing, wrestling, or other martial-arts contests that involve physical contact and serious risk of injury to themselves and to their counterpart, but only if they are fully aware of what they are doing.  Obviously, those under 18 or those who are not otherwise considered mentally-able to sign a contract should be barred from these sports for that reason.  And, of course, if someone chose to engage in combat sports without adequate ability to pay for potential injuries, I would consider that action to be selfish.  They are unduly burdening others in society for the sake of their own excitement.

So, ys, there are risks when engaging in extreme sports, but it is important to remember that there are risks in most sports. and in most aspects of daily life.  I hope that my point has been clear, that others should be free to take these risks with their own bodies, and with the bodies of willing co-participants.  

What would be selfish, would be forcing the risk of any kind of harm, including financial harm, on others who do not consent. 

The true question, and the one that should be addressed in public policy, is how to stop this behavior from propagating among those who may not.  Should a group insurance pool be set up for extreme athletes?  This is a practical question that could benefit from further discussion, but for now, I think my point has been clear, and I thank you for reading.",30,5,19,0,6,6,6,0,4,2,0.0,0.6333333333333333,0.2,0.4260515603799186

He tells you that he wants your help to implement the project. You are honored. However, you can't help but think that this superpower would be unpatriotic, especially if it is to rival the U.S. But JFK assures you that there is no such thing as an unpatriotic project. He says that the purpose of the superpower is to encourage the U.S. to continue innovating so it doesn't lose its edge. He says that the superpower is just to motivate the U.S. so it doesn't get too lax about its policies and then lose out to other countries that are real.

You agree that you will speak with your colleagues in the White House.  JFK is delighted to have your assistance and tells you that you absolutely won't regret this. The next day, you fly back to the White House and float JFK's ideas past your colleagues. They are skeptical, but agree to implement the project since they don't want to offend you and call you crazy. You promise them that the superpower is a good idea and will in fact motivate the U.S. As it turns out, the project is a massive success. It is successfully implemented and everyone is impressed at how much it motivates U.S. citizens to keep innovating and brainstorming new ideas all the time.

One day, she’s walking down the street and sees a man she’s never seen before. She tries to get a good look at him without staring.  She’s not sure why she’s so interested, but she feels like she’s seen him before. She’s never been to this part of town before, but she feels like she’s been here before. She stops walking and takes her phone from her bag. She pretends to send a text while she waits to get a better look at the man. He starts walking in her direction. She looks up and sees him looking at her. Her heart skips a beat. She looks down at her phone and pretends to send another text. She looks up again, and he’s gone. She looks around for a moment, confused. She shrugs and begins to turn around, and finds him standing right there. She gasps and drops her phone. 
“I’m sorry,” he says, bending down to pick it up.
 She is blushing, and reaches to help him. Their hands touch as they both reach for the phone. She feels a jolt of electricity. ""Ow!"" she says, pulling her hand back.

She froze. ""What?"" she asked. She felt embarrassed. ""No, I haven't, I mean-"" He laughed again. Those eyes!

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, reading and listening are complementary and depend on your environment.  For example, driving can easily be done while listening to an audiobook. But in bad weather or traffic, I cannot concentrate on the audiobook, so I prefer to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes or folding laundry.

Environment aside, reading and listening are two different cognitive states. Reading actively involves deciphering the words as you read, while listening forces you to imagine the words and images in your head. I find that I retain much more from a book I have read, rather than listened to it, though the former takes much more time than the latter.

When I read I can stop and reflect on an idea or phrase, look up references, skim, re-read, and comfortably proceed at my chosen pace. When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine the sound of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.

So much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like. None allow the consumer to enter into a process of co-creation with the author like reading does. When I watch a movie I am distant, but reading is an act of intimacy in which the reader and author engage. 

The good reader, it is said, reads with a pen in hand. Reading demand attention and engagement in a way that audiobooks never do.

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, some states' prefer to pretend that when it comes to older students sex does not exit. Period shaming is part of that benighted attitude. If anything with the word ""period"" or ""tampon"" appears in a school, then that school has failed in its duty to the state.

But what's the reality here?
The reality is that there are a lot of girls who have periods.
 The blood will flow, it's a fact of life. And in schools where this reality is not addressed, girls with periods can become pariahs. If students judge others for clothing, poverty, race, and social class, what makes us think that girls having periods would not be attacked too?
TIfgirls are not given the tools to deal with their periods, they will be forced to deal with them in a way
 that demeans them and reinforces negative attitudes toward a spectrum of related gender and sexuality issues. Misogyny, poverty, LGBTQ rights: these are real issues in schools, and period poverty is yet another way to reinforce the marginalization of what should be protected classes.
The question is not whether schools should provide pads and tampons.
 Of course they should. But more deeply, will the schools try to protect the weak, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised, the loner? What is the life lesson that period-shaming victims are learning? That they don't count and will likely never count. That they are not worthy of protection. That they are not worthy of empathy. That they are not worthy of respect.

In my opinion, schools are ideally responsible for the safety, health, welfare and formal education of young people. Unfortunately, many school districts barely have funding to provide education, leaving absolutely nothing for considerations of health and welfare of the children. And that doesn't even factor in the other things that schools are responsible for (building maintenance, transportation of students and special needs children, etc.

The short answer is yes, schools should be providing everything that any and all students may need, throughout the school day. Unfortunately, the text above isn't an opinion piece, and so the short answer, though likely correct, is rather unsatisfying. It is disingenuous to suggest that schools should provide more material resources than they are afforded by their communities. The slightly longer and much sadder answer is, yes they should provide such resources to students, if they can afford to do that. That is not ideal, but it is the reality faced by school administrators.

The problem of sanitary napkins in schools cannot be addressed without first addressing the broader social issue of community expenditures. Communities decide how to allocate funds, and until they allocate a sufficient amount to the school systems that serve their children, the schools are not, ultimately, to blame for a lack of resources. That said, it is the school administrators’ responsibility to find creative ways to be responsive to vulnerable populations within their districts. There needs to be a renewed interest in renaissance values to get the necessary funding and there needs to be accountability, from an administrative point of view, for how the funds are used. It's a multi-faceted problem that begins with voter mindset.

There can be no simple solution to this problem. For now, administrators will have to do the best they can with what they have.",21,7,11,0,3,4,3,1,0,3,0.0,0.5238095238095238,0.14285714285714285,0.547945205479452

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

My parents encouraged me to work and earn from an early age. From the age of 12 I had a paper route, got my working papers at 16, and worked summers in the factory where my grandfather worked. I gave money to my Mom to help with the expenses. I was never that good at sports, but fail to see the difference between me working in a factory or getting paid to play football. Each is a paying job which a young person is lucky to have.

Paying student athletes to pay sports is about as American as it gets. It is a way to reward the best and brightest for their efforts. It is a way to encourage the best and brightest to stay in school. It is a way to keep the best and brightest from being lured away by professional sports agents or teams. 

Who could possibly object to making it financially worthwhile for a young person to stay in school? Karl Marx?

Getting paid to compete does not ""distort"" economics as McDavis claims, getting paid to compete is the essence of economics. In fact, te only thing that might distort the economics of college sports is the NCAA's rules against paying student athletes.


It is about time that we let market forces determine who plays where in college. If a school wants to pay its players, let it. If a school wants to pay its players more than other schools, let it.

A pharmaceutical company, called MedLife had created a supplement, that when ingested, would let people live forever, or so they claim. Despite skepticism by some, the supplement, known as the ""Immortality Pill"" was a great success, and soon became a global phenomenon.

In my opinion, students should learn computer science and technology skills. Technology is changing increasingly rapidly today, and there are a lot of tools for people to learn and use to get what they want. Knowledge of these new technologies can help people understand what is happening, how they will benefit, and why they should use certain tools to get the desired things. 

I have personally benefitted from technology class the most. I learned the basics of programming, like HTML and Python, which I have been able to write codes that I use to help me to automate many tasks I perform in my finance job. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen at work, and I wanted to reduce my manual tasks to free up my time. I was able to write a tool that imports Excel spreadsheets and builds SQL databases based on the table structure. I then run data queries against those databases to get the results I want, and it has saved me a lot of time. 

I have received recognition for the success of my tool, and was able to license it to the company I work for.  n addition, I was selected from my company to participate in its Intrapreneurship program, working on software fservices or small businesses.
 The passion instilled in me by my first technology classes has driven me to continue exploring the technology field.  It has saved me time, made me money, set me on the path to promotions, and, above all, let me efficiently collaborate with others so that I can do work that I love, as a rising star in the field. 

Technology classes are so flexible, and technology so ubiquitous, there is virtually no industry that is not impacted by technology at all.

Audiobooks are a useful way for people to gain access to books and literature they otherwise would not have access to, especially for those for whose mobility is limited, such as the elderly or people with physical disabilities. In addition, they are helpful for people who are more time constrained than others, who do not possess the time or energy to read or, even for those that find it is easier and more convenient to listen to an audio book than to read the same book. Those are all the advantages present in audiobooks, but if one wants to go further, there are some smaller but none-the-less important advantages. For audiobooks are also more accessible by those who are illiterate as well as those who cannot read as fast as is required to follow along with a print book. They are a good way for people to entertain and occupy themselves, and potentially learn more about a topic. More people can hear an audiobook at a given time, which can open up discussion and potential further engagement with one another. And most importantly, it is a gateway to literature for those who may not have access to the written word, or who might not enjoy reading as much. For audiobooks need not to compete with the concept of reading, for they are a good complement for it that is accessible and available to many.

Just as audiobooks have advantages that worth considering, so do print books. When reading, a person can set their own pace and decide for themselves how long to spend with the book, not having to worry about listening time. In addition, they can become more invested in the literature, as reading makes the person more able to picture the events of the story, and even gives the reader greater input in how the story is read, as audiobooks have set narrators that voice the characters and events of the story. For me, these are appealing benefits that draws me more to reading, than to listening to an audiobook. That isn't to say as mentioned I would discourage the use of audiobooks for myself nor for others, just that if given the choice and time, I would find reading more enjoyable. That is the critical aspect of both audiobooks and written literature, that ideally both should be available as a choice for people all around the world. They both provides benefits and drawbacks that the other lacks, and I feel they can coexist without competition. I think the two main choices will boil down to the preferences of the user, and they ultimately have to decide which works best for them at any given point in their life.

In the process of doing so, they attempt to overthrow the government of China and replace it with a new one. Their attempts to overthrow the Chinese government are futile. In retaliation, China declares war on the United States. The Chinese empire has grown too strong and too powerful. The United States cannot compete. The United States government, in an attempt to save the country, takes drastic measures. The United States decides the most drastic yet logical thing to do is to surrender to the Chinese empire. In exchange for the United States' surrender, China will not continue on to conquer the world. However, the United States must adopt all Chinese culture and abandon American ways of life. 
The United States agrees to the terms.
 The United States becomes known as the New Atlantic China and develops a new currency that is entirely crypto. The United States is put under Chinese rule.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

I think the stereotypes in general in media I consume that makes me cringe relate to ones that are based on race, gender, and aspects of a person that overall causes harm to people that are associated with such demographics. For example, shows that have characters that are a stereotype of race in general causes me to cringe.  Stereotypes on how characters of a particular race act comes to mind, but also stereotypes in literature or art on how people of a specific race look is also things that make me cringe. The primary reasons for why is because I have first-hand experience of being stereotyped for many reasons, including race, gender, and my sexuality, which stems from the stereotypes that are not only perpetuated in society among people, but also reinforced in popular media such as TV shows and movies. I know others experience similar negative incidents, as stereotypes can often portray them not only in a negative manner, but also make people assume things about them that are not true.

I would definitely not watch or read something if an offensive portrayal of someone exist in such content. I think there are plenty of content and media that I can watch and enjoy that actually portrays its characters in a respectful manner, and I shouldn't have to consume or even be exposed to content that is offensive in nature. While many shows and movies might still contain stereotypes or tropes related to its characters, their is a fine line to be noted regarded how offensive said character is. Primarily that is whether or not the character is portrayed in a negative manner, and the likelihood that others would associate that character as representative of the group or demographic they are stereotyping. 

Overall, I am not a fan of stereotypes in media, and I think they are often used to perpetuate negative stereotypes that are not only harmful to people, but also reinforce the beliefs that people hold towards others. Stereotypes are not necessary for stories and different forms of content, they can be avoided. While it is effortful to create and make characters that defies stereotypes and even popular tropes, I believe it can be done by many. Many content and media available today do not portray its characters as nothing more than stereotypes, and I think if that continues to do so such, stereotypes will be less reinforced and held by people in society.",16,4,9,0,3,6,3,3,0,3,0.0,0.5625,0.1875,0.42792792792792794
937,80624eb1f1d241e8b1fa4cdc70d43f0a.jsonl,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons fall into a category of personal products that are both essential to students at times, but are generally only provided 'as needed.' That is, they aren't provided as a matter of course. Do schools supply students with enough toilet paper to use at home? No. Do they give students soap to take with them and wash their hands 7 days a week? Heck no! Are students given a supply of Band-Aids to take home and use whenever they cut themselves during the year? Of course not! 

All of these items are provided to students when they are needed on school facilities, but clearly students have access to them at home, too, not provided by the school, but by their parents. Tampons are a little different, in that, unlike soap, which students might use at home, and then need in the school bathroom, a tampon or pad is typically used while in a hygienic spot, the bathroom at home, and then worn until it is removed, and only replaced in public when it's absolutely needed. However they are replaced, in public, semi-routinely and women are likely to carry a supply with them in a variety of situations. 

Menstruating female students are unlikely to come to school without a tampon and then suddenly need a pad or tampon during the day; they are likely to be carrying those supplies with them. If for some reason they are not, a student should be able to simply ask to go to the bathroom, or school clinic, and a staff person should be able to provide her with a pad or tampon.

So, asking schools to provide students who might occasionally need a pad or tampon, is reasonable. Asking them to constantly supply them with such items, is unreasonable, and would be akin to asking the school to continually provide students with toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, to use whenever they needed them at home.",22,7,5,1,9,22,17,5,1,16,0.045454545454545456,0.22727272727272727,0.45454545454545453,0.4473007712082262

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that it is the responsibility of each person to keep up with current events, to at least some degree. I think that it is important to know what is going on in the world, and to be aware of the issues that are affecting people around you. We live in a society, and while most people are naturally aware of what affects them, they need to actively seek out news and information that doesn't affect them directly. And this is the responsible thing to do if you want to be a good neighbor and citizen. 

It is even more important today than in the past. News is easier to obtain today, and communication spreads wider and faster than ever before. And that is the main point. If people are going to be talking and sharing information, they have a duty to be informed about the events and context that they are talking about. If you are going to be talking about the news, you need to know what you are talking about. Otherwise you risk sharing false information and hurting others for no cause. 

Also, I think people have far more of an impact than they realize. They may not see that impact as an individual but, again, everyone is so connected these day that the power of the collective is enormous. If everyone were to be more informed, and more aware of the world around them, I think that we could make a huge difference. To exist, and act without being informed about the possible consequences of your actions is irresponsible at best. 
IFinally, people are always saying that they want a better world, that there are problems that must be solved, etc. But they don't do anything about it. Just being informed is the first step, and one that is easy enough that there is no justification not to do so. Being informed is the best way to start creating the world you want to live in.

In short, being informed about current events is the responsible thing to do. If you want to be a part of society, have opinions, and take actions the only choice is to be informed so that you do right and make good choices. It will not only help you be a better person, but will help you make the world a better place. ",26,6,14,0,6,11,6,5,3,3,0.0,0.5384615384615384,0.23076923076923078,0.4034334763948498

It was entirely different world with different nations being the most powerful and some nations were not even around anymore.

All of Latin America formed into the Union, with the exception of Mexico and Cuba. Cuba remained independent and neutral and served as a major port hub for other nations so they were enjoying a new era of riches and prosperity. 

The US was looking for an ally because everything was so shaken up, so they turned to their neighbors of the North; the always neutral, always friendly, Canada. Canada had stayed out of the war and stayed neutral throughout it even though it was constantly cajoled by France and Spain to join the war. Canada's leaders ignored the calls but it turned out that keeping quiet wasn't enough to keep them out of this war. Because they stayed out, they also were enjoying an era of prosperity.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not technically wrong for someone to focus more on animal welfare over human suffering. I think if someone is focused on suffering at all than they are pretty selfless in that aspect. I think it is more of a matter of perspective. The reason why people are more sensitive to animal rights is simply because we are less desensitized to seeing animals abused over humans. We see this happening to humans so often in movies, in real life, on the news, etc. I think humans have kind of built up a shell to when they see things like this. Animal suffering however is something that is more rare to us, and this causes a greater emotional response. So for the simple reason on why people tend to focus more on animal suffering, i think it has to do with the media. Throw the media out and i think the emotional response would be closer to even or even more on the human side. I personally also would say that animals produce more of a reaction in me when i see them suffering over humans. However, if i were to see a human suffering like that in person it may be different. 

The debate over whether someone would save their pet dog or a foreign tourist actually makes sense to me. Your pet is part of your family, so I would assume most people would save their pet over someone they did not know. If you have to make the choice, you would make the one that effects you the most. Saving your pet would save you from the sorrow you would face if your pet was gone. If the foreign tourist died, you would be upset for a day and then most likely be ok. You did not know the person personally, so all you are going to remember is the death itself. If you pet died, you would look back on all the memories, the love, and also the death. Not only this, but you are basically loosing a family member who you have come to care about. So tying this back to the main idea, i dont think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans are suffering. Everyone has that choice, and what they deem as more important goes strictly off of their perspective and their life in general. I could not say anyone is wrong for focusing on animal suffering. Sometimes, people may even feel like they can have more of an effect on animal suffering over human suffering. There are so many humans everywhere in different governments and demographics. Ending their suffering is really an unattainable goal in a way. So in conclusion, this is my stance on animal vs human suffering.",31,7,23,0,1,3,1,2,0,1,0.0,0.7419354838709677,0.03225806451612903,0.4098073555166375

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things that students will learn in school are the value of knowledge, discipline and hard work.   And most importantly, is the experience of acquiring knowledge and applying it to solve real-life problems.  All of these things will no doubt help individuals with their future success. tudents can benefit from learning the important things of life, which include lessons on how to solve conflict, the ability to overcome difficulty, and
 realizing they have what it takes to be successful in life. The  most successful people have worked really hard on a consistent basis in order to achieve what they have.

Talent is a great thing to have but talent can be beat out with hard work, but if one is talented plus works hard then they have so much potential. I still think that consistency is the most important value to perform on a daily basis because most people are not consistent to the point of doing something even when they don't feel like doing it anymore when the novelty and excitement of a project has worn off. That's what makes the difference between people who achieve great things or not. 

Consistency is also underrated by many people because people take it for granted that it is automatic to do something no matter how hard your might feel. So when they don't achieve the results they expect, they stop without even noticing. What many don't realize is that consistency and discipline go hand and in hand in achieving great success in anything in life. The most successful people were consistent in acquiring knowledge with consistent day-in and day-out discipline in order to apply that knowledge to solve real-life problems. Albert Einstein is one great example. He failed college math but he preserved until he learned everything that he wanted to and because of that he became one of the great scientists of humankind. 

If you follow these three principles of acquiring knowledge, having discipline consistently and to work hard you will be successful in life. ",20,6,8,1,5,8,6,2,3,3,0.05,0.4,0.3,0.46

In my opinion, college athletes should definitely be paid.   I disagree with the statement made by Cody J. McDavis.  McDavis admits these student-athletes generates a lot of money for their schools.  If you are generating large amounts of money for your school, you should certainly get a piece of that income.  If you look at events like the NCAA Basketball tournament,  you will see that these events generate millions of dollars for those involved.  For example, the NCAA Basketball Tournament is worth $8 billion to CBS and Time Warner.  The reason why this tournament is so valuable are only due to the players.

It is not fair that we have corporations and schools that are making billions of dollars off of the work of student athletes.     Shouldn't these student athletes get a percentage of the money?  In any business, the workers who are helping to sell the products of the business gets a wage.  These student athletes are selling and producing the product--sports.  


o Why Not Pay Students to Play?
  Ultimately, I believe there are many organizations who do not wish to share the profit with these athletes.  They understand that their share of the financial pie goes down when the athletes are allowed to sit at the table.  McDavis mentions that paying athletes would create an unfair advantage for big sports programs.  However, that is already occurring.  Big sports programs already have many ways to attract top talent.  

Student athletes are producing a very valuable product.  They deserve to get a cut of the profits that their schools and other corporations are getting.   They deserve to receive a fair piece of the pie.",28,9,15,0,4,4,4,0,2,2,0.0,0.5357142857142857,0.14285714285714285,0.5298165137614679

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid. I believe that the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans, training with a professional program and team,  and the chance to get a college education is enough. 
I believe that paying college athletes would ruin college sports.
 I believe that paying college athletes would cause a bidding war between colleges. Colleges would have to overpay for a handful of athletes, and have to cut funding for other activities.

There would be no ""underdog with a chance to win"", no dark horses, just the haves, and the have-nots. We'd have a few super-programs who dominated everything due to their excessive cash-bought top talent.  The money would go to a select few athletes, leaving the rest of the team with less. In a society already dominated by money, we'd just be allowing another thing to become ""pay-to-win"".
IPying college athletes would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni.
 Rural and poorer schools would have losing teams, harming the opportunities for motivation and success of some students.  There would be inequality in payment, and inequality in opportunity.  
The NCAA is a non-profit organization.
 It is a community of schools, and the athletes are part of that community. It returns all of its profits to the schools and the furthering of athletic programs. It works to keep schools a place of learning, not a place of money and business. 
I believe that the NCAA is a great organization, and I believe that it should stay that way.

In my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. 

I do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. But in the end, it isn't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad if you don't live politically. I would even argue now it is almost better to not like politically or at least make it known about your politics. The topic of politics have been getting bad with Trump losing, vaccines, and wearing masks. And people get a lot of their political information from the news. Some people have a favorite news station that is usually biased to one side of the spectrum. And that doesn't do good as a country to have people rely on one station for all their information.

Overall no not keeping up with the news does not make you a citizen. If you choose to live you life that way then more power to you. I do think it is good though to keep informed. But doing so does not make you a good citizen.",25,6,16,1,2,6,3,3,0,3,0.04,0.64,0.12,0.3898305084745763

In my opinion, engaging with current events is important to everyone. Every person has some responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If one does not know what is going on with the world around them, they cannot make informed decisions or become involved with civic issues. Therefore, it is important to be informed and engaged so you can contribute to your community. eing informed and t ettnng ivolved is not a full-time job but every member of society should have some basic knowledge and interest in what is
 happening in their society and around the world. Inconvenience of time is not an excuse to turn away from the news. One can decide how much time they want to spend getting informed. Even if it is just a few minutes everyday , it is still good enough. If nothing else, every media outlet has a website with live updates that can be accessed at any time. Even the local news can be recorded and watched later. There is no reason not to be informed, as long as it does not take up too much time.

This will surely be some sort of catastrophe and create a hierarchy of dads, some insisting that their ranking is wrong because their lawn is nicer than their neighbor's or that they can grill a better steak. This is a disaster not on a global scale, but from neighborhood to neighborhood; the dads that rank higher will demand the respect their rank brings them. This happened in my own neighborhood.
When the #1 Dad mug changed, my street was of two minds.
 Most of the men that were in the top ten on my street, decided that they would be #1 and began strutting down the street like they owned the place. They started making rules about the street and demanding that the houses with the lower ranking dads do their bidding. It was total chaos and no one could agree on how to handle the new hierarchy of dads.

The numbers on the mugs seemed to change nearly every day, because there were literally hundreds of millions of dads ranked on these mugs so it didn't take long for my street to come up with their own ranking system. If your mug fell within a range of numbers, you were given a shorter, cleaner number that went from 1-10. There was only a few dads with a 1, and most were 5-7, and a few were 9 and 10. It was sort of like a bell curve like you would see when grades are weighted. This made the rankings easier to understand.  t least this was better than our previous ranking system, when we just made up a number to represent the ranking of a dad. and the numbers changed wildly.

My neighbor was a dad and he had always ranked around eight out of ten but he was going to gun for a ranking of 1 with his new tricks. He didn't care much about the rankings, but he wanted to upset the current 1 ranked dad, Mario, since he was such a jerk. Mario would make rules and order people around like they were his personal slaves and it was time that stopped.

My neighbor put together a plan that would raise his rank that involved grilling, mowing the lawn, playing catch with his kids, and doing the ultimate dad move that would boost his rank the most ; get along with his mother in law.
The plan was simple.
 He was going to invite his mother in law over for a cookout, grill her a perfect steak, and round out the day playing a game of catch as a family. Well, the day arrived and he did just that. The plan went off without a hitch and he went to bed, excited to see his new rank. 
He woke up the next day, ready to see how well this plan went off.
 He walked into his kitchen, opened his cupboard, and retrieved his dad mug. He turned it over and looked at the new number on his mug and consulted the neighborhood guide to translate the new number to align with the neighborhood ranking system.

Everytime that the wolf would come by would always be for a reason either to make fun of the pig, remind the pig of his famous three brothers, or to simply annoy him. Needless to say, the wolf did not hold a good place in the pig's heart. ""Where can i go to get the material to make a house like this?"" Said the wolf. ""I am not sure. I just looked around in the forest for the most part"" said the pig. The wolf did not believe the pig, and you could see it on his face. "" I guess ill just go look in the forest then...."" the wolf said sarcastically. Just like that the wolf ran off to the forest and the pig gladly shut the door of his home. The pig was very familiar with what it was like to have the wolf repeatedly come over and mess with him, however this time he truly had built a grand home. 

A week or so later the pig looked outside his window and could see the wolf rebuilding his own home. The wolf started from scratch and aimed to make a home stronger than the pigs. There was a knock on the door at that instant. The 92nd pig opened the door. Low and behold it was his three famous brothers. ""Hi guys, what brings you in town!?!"" says the 92nd pig. ""Hey! We heard about your new home and we just wanted to come by and say congratulations."" The 92nd pig knew there was something fishy, as he had not seen his brothers in years.

he man in these stories is a boss, a millionaire, a hero, he must travel the world and have women fawning over
 him.  Her long awaited Prince Charming cannot be less than movie-star handsome, he must play ball with orphans, and he has to read books too. He will never think of the woman that holds his heart as an equal, but an object to be worshiped.

Humans once wielded formidable magical power, powered by an energy source that was once abudant on the planet called mana. However, over time, when humanity reached a population of 7 billion, Mana began to deplete, seemingly becoming spread too thinly for it to have an effect. This prove troublesome when alien forces attacked the planet one fateful day.

Humanity was powerless to stand against the hostile alien forces, who wielded superior technology not reliant on Mana. When the alien forces reduced humanity to a mere fraction, the remaining survivors discover that a means to reawaken Mana to its past potential. Stumbling onto an ancient temple, one that predates the majority of modern civilizations, the survivors learned of a way to rejuvenate the Mana of the planet, making it so humans could once again wield magic. 
However, not all were in agreement.
 For the cost of doing so, means that many would have to be sacrificed, their souls powering an ancient machine to create new sources of Mana. For that was the true source of past Mana, ancient humans that were killed by ancient civilizations who deemed their sacrifice critical for the survival of mankind. 
The survivors argued, debating the ethics of the practice.
 Failure to make such a sacrifice would surely entail that the aliens would win, who would not only take over the planet for its natural resources, but also kill off the remaining humans. The sacrifice was argued by many to be too great, given how little people remained on the planet. 
In the end, many volunteered, giving their lives to make the sacrifice to save the rest of humanity.
 With the sacrifice completed, the energy from it restored Mana to its full potential. The remaining humans were able to wield magic once again, and defeated the aliens with ease. Unfortunately, in the end the created Mana was depleted once again, and the survivors found themselves powerless once again. Many were filled with guilt from the sacrifice made by those who volunteered to create Mana to stop the aliens, others with fear that the ancient machine may be abused by future generations. So the survivors agreed to seal the location of the ancient machine, and remove all traces of Mana from literature and existence. 
Now, a hundred years later, humanity has recovered.
 Instead of Mana, humanity focused on technology instead, given that they no longer wielded the magic that was once available in the past. Most were unaware that humanity wielded magic, nor had any idea that Mana existed at one point in time.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

Since the creation of digital devices and its implementation, I believe many have been wary to have people depend on screens, instead of in person interactions.  think the worry is that we are losing our ability to communicate with each other, and that we are losing our ability to be social.
 This however is not a new or recent worry, in fact many believed the same with the implementation of writing, and the widespread use and access of literature. Back then, people worried that book writing and reading would cause humans as a whole to lose the ability to interact with one another, and they feared it would lead to the deterioration of society over time. ut as we know, this was not the case.
 I think the worries and concerns regarding screen use are similar and applicable to the ones that were made in the past towards written literature. In fact, I believe that even if screen use becomes more refined and widespread, there will still be benefits and values for people to continue to interact in person and without the use of screens, and that technology like smartphones will be better integrated and moderated in the lives of people.
I believe that the benefits of screen use far outweigh the negatives.
 Even considering that during the pandemic that the screen use of people has notably increased, for most due to remote work and others for their safety and to limit the spread of the virus, screen use will not replace many of the interactions people hold for the time being. Remote work and similar usages of screen use during the pandemic was a means to make due during the pandemic, and for many jobs and workers, it was not a adequate replacement for them. For example retail workers, would still work as well as other essential workers. I think beyond them , there are many other people that would not be able to work remotely out of both preference and necessity, and would still need to go into the office or other places of work. For them, it is more engaging to work in person with colleagues, and their fellow co-workers. Still, there are people who benefit from the remote work option, and after the pandemic ends will continue to do so. For that reason, I don't think that is reasonable to worry about the increase in usage and dependency of screen use from the pandemic, as when the pandemic subsides, it is likely that many will reduce their usage out of necessity, and for work, school, and social interactions. The benefits of screen use ought to be embraced during the pandemic and afterwards, for they allow people to stay connected when they are unable to, out of safety or for other personal reasons. Screen use will not cause most to depend on it solely in their lives, like written work and literature, many will learn over time to moderate it, and find a balance in their life regarding its usage to maximize its benefits.",22,6,12,0,4,5,4,1,3,1,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.18181818181818182,0.4058219178082192

I grew up watching this thinking nothing of it even though I went to a highly integrated school.  The same thing seemed to happen at school, there would be clicks of white kids with one black kid in their group, usually a boy. It makes me wonder now if the shows we were watching influenced that behavior. I think so and it is damaging. Usually the African American/Token black guy is a basic, one sided character with a few funny catch phrases. Usually nothing more from my experience. I really started to notice it toward the end of high school and then it became a known thing in college. It was something we were all aware of, realized it was probably not right but still perpetuated it out of habit. I think it is a subconscious thing that we are not aware of when making friends, it just kind of happened. These black friends were more then token black friends to us though. They were full human beings like the rest of us. I look back and wish we included more minorities in our groups. We would have all been better for it.

He decided to take her to a restaurant that he knew she loved. He picked her up in his car, and they drove to the restaurant.

She didn't know where they were going yet, because the shapeshifter wanted it to be a surprise. He made sure to wear her favorite color so she would enjoy looking at him, and he added just a drop of her favorite cologne. He was going to make this the best date ever. 
When they arrived, he opened the door for her, and they walked into the restaurant.
 He had made reservations, so they were able to be seated immediately. The waiter took their drink orders, and they looked over the menu. 
The shapeshifter had been to this restaurant many times, so he knew exactly what to order.: eggplant parmesan with wedding soup. It would show the woman that while he indulged sometimes, he knew how to do it without going overboard. The woman asked if they could share their meals so that they could both eat a variety of food.

 While they waited for their food, the shapeshifter told the woman how amazing she was and that the time they have spent dating had been the best time in his life. The woman was quite flattered and returned the sentiment. 
The waiter brought their food, and they began to eat.
 The shapeshifter cut a portion of his eggplant parmesan to give to the woman before he had eaten any of it, and she did the same with her meal. It was wonderful to experience the different flavors that they each enjoyed.

After they finished eating, the shapeshifter asked if the woman would like to go for a walk along the beach. She said yes, so they took a stroll in the sand. With the wind blowing gently against them, the shapeshifter stopped and knelt on one knee. The woman figured out immediately what was happening and smiled widely.

The shapeshifter asked the woman to marry him, anxiously waiting for her response. She said yes! The shapeshifter had figured out that the key to the woman's heart was showing her respect and love. ",29,3,18,0,8,13,8,5,2,6,0.0,0.6206896551724138,0.27586206896551724,0.45869565217391306

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, I prefer listening to audiobooks than reading books. I have a long commute to and from work, so I listen to audiobooks on my way to and from work. I also listen to audiobooks while I'm doing workout or chores around the house. I find that listening to audiobooks is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day, especially if your daily work involves lots of reading. 

There are advantages to listening to audiobooks that cannot be gained by reading books. First, listening to audiobooks doesn't strain your eyes. econd, listening to audiobooks is a great way to multitask. because your hands can be freed to do other things
 Third, listening to audiobooks with headphones is a good option when you are in a loud environment which makes it difficult to focus on reading books. Lastly, listening to audiobooks is a great way to learn new words and improve your vocabulary.

As a conclusion, I prefer listening to audiobooks than reading books.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the ability to be disciplined is one of the most important lessons to learn in school.  School can't teach you everything that you need in the world.  However, it can teach you how to be disciplined in pursuing your goals.  Discipline is the ability to do what you know is right even when you don't want to.  I remember many times in school where I wanted to do something more entertaining instead of my schoolwork.  I wanted to read a book or play video games.  I had to learn to focus on my responsibilities instead of my desires.

Besides being disciplined, I believe creativity is an important skill that should be learned in school.  Creativity is the ability to think outside the box.  I do believe that this is a skill that can be trained.  In school, I took classes like art or even my speech classes that focused on creativity.  At first, I was afraid to be creative.  With time, I learned to start thinking outside of the box more.  Creativity allowed me to solve challenging problems inside school and outside of school.

When I face challenges today in my job, I think back about certain tasks in school that focused on creativity.  For example, in one of my classes we had to write a series of papers that were judged by the class.  At first, I was very afraid to write outside of the norm.  My classmates judged those papers very harshly.  I learned that if I wanted to be successful, I had to think outside of the box.  When I took more risks with my writing, my classmates responded much more favorably.  

With discipline and creativity, I think you can accomplish many great things in your life.  I do believe that these valuable lessons helped me to achieve a lot in my life.  I also believe these two skills will continue to benefit me as I get older.  Life will always throw problems at you that you haven't experienced.   I hope that my children will learn these valuable lessons in school.  ",30,6,20,0,4,6,4,2,0,4,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.13333333333333333,0.4408866995073892

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology worsen romantic interactions. I have read many reports of women and men stalking their partners, setting up surveillance equipment within each partner’s bedrooms and watching cell phone activity.  All these would cause conflicts and mistrust between the couples. In addition, over time I believe couples will have less and less interest in face-to-face meetings because they will be able to achieve a romantic relationship with people online. This will lead to less and less couples getting married as this sort of relationship is not legally binding. The traditional value in the society will be challenged in this way. People have fewer genuine relationships nowadays and so they will be lonely all their lives.  There is also a concern that some people will abuse the use of dating apps by pretending to be interested in long-term relationships but will hide such intentions. This again will ruin the relationship between the couples who are dating through dating apps. This has happened before. Because people do not trust each other, they are quick to believe their partner is having a love affair.  As a result, they do many things to the suspects including stalking and monitoring cell phone activities. This will result in breaking up relationships and might lead to even divorce as a consequence. Thus, I think that technology worsen romantic interactions and should be wisely used.",22,9,4,4,5,11,9,2,4,5,0.18181818181818182,0.18181818181818182,0.4090909090909091,0.576271186440678

Today was Father's Day and I was excited to give my father a mug, that I had especially engraved with the words ""*#1 Dad"".  I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said ""Happy Father's Day dad"", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. ""I love it"", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, ""the mug has changed"". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said ""#1 Dad"". The mug now said ""#25th Dad"". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.   I told my father that I did not know what happened and that I would go back to the store to get a new mug. He said it was okay and that I did not have to. He became very sad and left the table. I felt awful and wondered how I could make it right. I went to the store and asked the clerk if there was anything that could be done. The clerk looked at the mug and nothing had changed, it still said ""#1 Dad"". I explained that it had changed back at home and he did not believe me. He sent me away and said I was crazy. When I returned home, my father said he would do everything in his power to become the best dad ever. He started to work harder at his job and he came home earlier every day. He spent more and more time with me and my mother. He took us shopping and to special events in our community. He even started to cook dinner every night. He also read many books on how to become a better father. It was a happy moment for us all because he was spending a lot of time with us, but it was also saddening because he felt unworthy of being a great father. None of it was true, he was the best dad in the world to me. I knew it, and my mother did as well, but he did not. He became sad and depressed because he was using so much of his time and energy into becoming the best dad. He had no time to spend with his friends and he even started to lose his hair. He stopped going to work and had turned his back on his faith, his church. He had become a different man and a different person. He was no longer the father I knew and loved. I felt like I was losing my father slowly, but surely. My mother and I felt guilty for not seeing his downfall sooner. We felt that we had taken him for granted. We felt that we should have seen the signs and done something about it. I realized that my father was the best dad because he had spent so much time with us, after the mug changed in front of his eyes. It meant so much to him, that he did everything in his power to prove it to himself and us. The next day, I approached my dad at home and had a long, hard talk with him.   I told him that he was the best dad in the world and that he did not have to prove it to anyone. I said he was the ""#1 Dad"" to me and that the mug did not take that away from him. He had always been there for my family and we loved him for that. He was a great father and I did not need a mug to tell me that. He looked at me and the sadness lifted from his face, his being, his essence. He smiled, hugged me and told me that he loved me. My family learned a tough lesson that day.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical need for a gay best friend in most teen rom-com is the first thing I can think of when it comes to characters that are making me cringe. How unnecessarily the gay guy is always the one to tell the main character that her dress is unflattering or that he can't wait for her to break up with her, and how they are usually being flamboyant and the bud of the joke is something that's very insulting.

Of course there are outliers that are changing the narrative, such as the TV show Love, Victor, and Ellie, or the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower where the gay best friend gets to be an actual character instead of just supporting. In these stories, the gay characters or even any of the LGBT characters are portrayed to be multi-dimensional and not just the sidekick or plot device. Of course I understand that LGBT characters should not always be the good guys and they can be villains too,  and that is something that can also be expanded in today's media.

I can't think of any gay villains in any recent TV shows or movies that I have watched. Probably because authors or producers fear that the public won't buy into a gay villain because of negative connotations or stereotypes, but I'll bet they would be shocked to find out that as long as they outline the motive, or the ""why"" behind the character's bad behavior, they would be more accepted. Not that there's a need for an LGBT character to be accepted, but how LGBT characters have been portrayed in the past, I think we need a break from it or a push to win more roles as well as showcasing how there's plenty of LGBT characters to fall in love with.

And lastly, I cringe about how the typical gay bestie in rom-coms are typically the ones that are very out there with the flamboyancy, and they scream ""Hooker Queen"" with their over the top outfits and make-up. They are usually very sex-positive and is the go-to advice giver when it comes to the guy's wardrobe or his accessories. It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.

So to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. Make people be LGBT characters just because they can and not because they have to due to a need for a sidekick. It's time to showcase LGBT characters for who they are, and to allow LGBT actors and actresses to be multi-dimensional characters.",19,4,5,1,9,12,12,0,0,12,0.05263157894736842,0.2631578947368421,0.5263157894736842,0.4470802919708029

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't be too worried about excessive screen use right now. Digital devices have many benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. Can screen use get out of hand? Sure. If you are driving and looking at your phone to check your text messages, there's an issue. Luckily, there are laws that ban that and consequences come from that action.

When I think about screens, I think about the enjoyment that I get when I come home from work and can relax by watching my favorite television program. I think about having the ability to use my GPS whenever I am lost or am trying to find the quickest route to a place. I think about the ability to communicate via FaceTime with my family in Italy.

There is also the ability to just text a family member or friend and be able to get that message to them near instantly. Without screen time the Coronavirus pandemic would have been terrible. What would we have done if we were stuck inside, not able to go out and see friends and family and also didn't have a television or the internet?

I think people would have went insane. I personally know that most of my time during the pandemic was spent using the internet, watching sports and playing video games. There simply wasn't anything else to do.

I really think we need to appreciate just how much screens have benefited us. Talk to an elderly person and ask them how beneficial the invention of the television was. Just think about how our lives would be affected without the internet. Think about how many people wouldn't have a job.

Screen time can get out of control but I think most humans have enough discipline to not go overboard. We use our phones and screens for entertainment purposes.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Animals have different defenses than humans, and they are not as capable of defending themselves. The chances that the animal brought the abuse on themselves are impossible. Humans are more capable of defending themselves, and they have a choice on whether or not to do something. And in the case of humans, they have the ability to speak up for themselves. I think any empathetic person would defend any living being that is suffering abuse, whether human or animal.  In some cases, it could be assumed that the human did something to bring the injury on themselves in cases such as revenge. However, many times humans are attacked by other people, they are defenseless and helpless. I think the focus should be on the assailant.  Anyone that harms an animal needs help , and I think that they should be punished. There could be some debate about sentences for animal crimes versus human crimes.   However, I think that the focus should be on the person that committed the crime and their motivations for their actions.   I think that it is important to focus on both human and animal welfare equally. ",19,7,5,0,7,14,7,7,2,5,0.0,0.2631578947368421,0.3684210526315789,0.4662379421221865

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, Asians portrayed in American/western media can be very simplistic and offensive. They are often portrayed as being very smart, but also very socially awkward and shy. Being very smart in America is not looked kindly upon by a large minority of our population. So that too can be a damaging stereotype. I have known a variety of Asian people and some are smart, shy or awkward but most are just somewhere in between like the rest of us. Other then slight differences in facial features, they are just like every other human on earth. They fall along a spectrum of different social and personal types.   have also noticed that Asian men are often portrayed as being very effeminate.
 They are never the football player, they are always the almost a-sexual nerds. 
 have also noticed that Asian women are often portrayed as being very submissive and quiet.
 Or the exact opposite. These two stereotypes are also very unfair. The few Asian women I have gotten to know have been a mix of these traits and many more. People are much to complex to reduce them to a few simple stereotypes. Not just Asian people but all people. It has just been the Asian people in American media that has put a bad taste in my mouth over the years and I think its time we address it.

Stella thinks that she's one, been working too hard and two, except for their looks this one and all the ones before all seem to be the same to her.  She asks if there's been recent trouble between them, something that reminded her of the previous boyfriend.  The woman says there hasn't been any trouble, but she's not sure.  Thinking back she realizes the relationship is pretty much a mirror of all her relationships.  She wonders if that is why when she was looking at him the other night she thought she saw a resemblance.

Stella says maybe she should take a break from both work and this latest guy.  Book a vacation in a faraway peaceful place and put both work and romance on the backburner for a while.  ""Wouldn't want to end up in the looney bin"" Stella says.

Maybe one of those 'experience' type vacations where you learn some obscure handicraft or skill.

The kids are just upset that they don't have any cookies due to the constant squabbling, and the dogs are constantly barking because they can smell the tension at home, and because their feeding and walks have become increasingly erratic.

He returns to his life, humanity none the wiser that he's their savior.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

Student athletes should be compensated for their efforts during college, there performance is comparable to athletes that compete in higher divisions, such as the NFL or the NBA. It is fair to give payment to athletes who face strenuous training to reach the same level as professional athletes, given that such efforts come at a significant cost to athletes willing to compete and play competitively. Such training and competition takes time from players and given that they are enrolled in college, may prevent them from earning a stable income from a job, something that many college students do alongside their studies to pay for tuition and other school costs. Compensation for college athletes, like student who work for their colleges and university, would represent a fairer system for athlete rewards while allowing players to pay for their education expenses. 

This compensation can be determined based on need as oppose to performance, to avoid disparities from arising among the pay given to athletes. Without some form of moderation, some athletes may be paid significantly more than others, as McDavis suggests, leading to negative outcomes for colleges wishing to pay for said players to be on their teams. If players are all paid equally and fairly for their efforts, then players not only can afford all expenses in their life, but also feel motivated to continue to improve and perform in their sports. This can benefit the colleges and can be seen as a worthwhile investment, rather than a monopoly on the part of athletes. Instead of bidding wars, colleges can instead make tactile trades to get athletes they desire, by trading other athletes that may show potential given time. Such trades, also show support for players who may feel valuable to a future team and wish to continue their careers in sports once they find the right college. Just as professional athletes are paid, so too should college level athletes be paid for their efforts in an equal and fair manner, based on the notion that they bring in positive outcomes for their college. This not only benefits players by reducing stress in their life from finances and potential debt, but also helps the university in the long run as it increases their revenue and reduces costs by avoiding bidding wars for top players.",20,9,6,0,5,7,5,2,2,3,0.0,0.3,0.25,0.4907749077490775

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Technology has made dating better. When just going to a bar was the best way to meet someone, you were limited to very few people that you'd actually want to talk to after. Now, the chances of meeting someone on a dating app that really catches your eye has increased exponentially. 

Technology has slowly been improving our perspectives. Early television showed us the possibility of different kinds of relationships. 
etflix shows us realistic examples of relationships where one or more characters have some kind of disability.
 ocial media gives us the opportunity to look at the silly sides of being in a relationship as well as sad.
 You can research anything on the internet from health to dating to getting married.

 research conducted at the University of Virginia revealed that couples who watch romantic comedy movies tend to have higher marriage satisfaction than those who don't.
 The researchers found that while watching romantic comedy movies, loving and caring feelings were enhanced between the partners. 
Many believe that the internet has facilitated romantic relationships.
 Texting, dating apps, ad social media allow us to have a relationship with the perfect person, while thousands of miles away. If things don't work out, it becomes easy to end the relationship. 

I've met some of my best friends on social media. We often started out in groups with common interests. We'd chat a bit here and there, nothing too personal or deep. We learned about each other, talked about our lives a little and slowly became closer.  

I've met the most important person in my life on a social media. He is pretty much my everything right now. We were casual for a while, just liking each others' pictures and having fun.   Soon we started text each other more often, and started going out for coffee or for a run. It slowly became deeper, we started opening up more and getting closer. Things progressed, we became a couple and have been happy together for just over two and a half years now!

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it depends on what the news tells us. These days, the internet, the radio, the TV, and the newspapers are full of terrible news, unfortunately. So it depends on what, if anything, we can do about this news. I would argue that things such as COVID news are important to pay attention to, so that we can know what is safe to do and how we can protect others. Other news can be very important, but also deeply distressing to read, and knowing the information doesn't actually allow us to help other people. When it becomes important is when it comes to what we share, and how we participate civically.

There is so much misinformation out there, that we should be informed when we choose to share a fact or opinion. That is the least we can do. Plus, if we see a dubious-looking claim, it is up to us to get the correct information and correct the person. Furthermore, when it comes time to go into a voting booth, we need to be filled with good, true information.
There are cases where we would be bad citizens if we aren't up to date on world happenings.
 Especially if we're an undecided voter, or if there's a crisis unfolding where we can personally have a true impact. Don't get me wrong, it's generally important to be up to date on what is happening in the world. But for the sake of our own mental state, it can be helpful to filter what we take in. Do we need to know the latest guidelines from the CDC? 100%. Do we need to know the details of a presidential summit in Europe? Less so. Once again, this is good information to know, but there is so much news out there that we not only should not be expected to always be completely on top of it, but we also should feel free to not absorb every morsel of it.
People think that if they don't keep up with the news, then other people will think less of them.
 But I think the issue lies more with making sure to get correct and complete information before forming an opinion, and living your life based upon truth. As long as I have knowledgeable opinions based on objective facts, I will be able to participate in a democracy, I will be able to advocate for what I believe in, and I will be able to contribute to my society. 

Another situation where it is indeed important to be up to date on the news is when it comes to having perspective. Realizing where one stands in the world. For example, recent news from Afghanistan should cause people to feel strong empathy for the people there, and recognize their privilege, if not there, to be living in a place that is not under Taliban rule. One need not necessarily pore over every detail, but we should be informed enough to be compassionate.

In conclusion, we don't need every bit of news out there. And we need to filter what we take in, making sure to only draw from reliable sources. But we can also accept how overwhelming the 24-hour news cycle can be, and realize that we don't need to know every single thing that's happening. We can still be well informed, without being exhausted. Just make sure you always have a grip on reality, and are well informed on what matters for you to be a good citizen.",36,6,26,0,4,6,4,2,2,2,0.0,0.7222222222222222,0.1111111111111111,0.4117647058823529

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't really get too up in arms about screen time during COVID. Yes, we do need to be aware of the possible side effects of excessive use of digital devices on our mental and physical health. Using technology can cause eye strain, and it can also be a waste of time if it prevents us from getting our chores and work assignments done. But we also need to be aware of the risks of staying disconnected from digital networks. Especially in this time of fear and social distancing, we shouldn't be afraid to stay connected in a meaningful way. 
If we do, we may lose an opportunity to provide meaningful support for each other while we all go through this experience together.
 And we all know that having someone who is there for you during a crisis can make all the difference. Who cares if the call was made on a laptop, a smartphone or an old fashioned telephone? I certainly don't, because it's the experience of connection, not the device itself, that matters most. I think that for myself, my iPad has been a huge saving grace for me during the pandemic. It has been the only way I feel I have been able to stay connected with my family and friends around the world. My family lives in Thailand, and I work from home in London, so it's been a real lifeline for me to stay in touch with the people who mean the most in my life. I normally go visit my family in Thailand every year or so, but unfortunately due to the COVID pandemic, I have had to cancel all of my travel plans to visit them. Thankfully I was able to get a credit from the airline toward future travel when I cancelled my travel plans; however, it's been really tough for me and no doubt for my family as well. So I have really made the most of the apps that are available on the iPad to keep in touch with them. I love using Skype to chat to my mum whenever I can get a few minutes, and the FaceTime app has been a fantastic way for me to keep in touch with my sister and my best friend in Thailand. My best friend got married in Bangkok on the 12th April this year, and I was so very sad that I couldn't attend the wedding, especially because she had a blowout venue and she told me she had booked the best caterer in all of Southeast Asia. But using FaceTime, we were able to reconnect over the happy occasion and it meant the world to me to be included in that important day in my best friend's life. I don't think I would have been able to feel so included if I hadn't had my iPad with me. 

So in conclusion, I think we should update our thinking in terms of screen time during this period: With COVID in full swing, the risks of staying digitally disconnected far outweigh the risks of staying digitally connected. Yes, I totally understand that we need to exercise a certain level of caution when it comes to staying connected and using our digital devices in an excessive and unsustainable way. I mean, I've definitely heard horror stories about folks who literally became housebound with their iPad, refusing to let it leave their side, letting it ruin their sleep and eating habits. But it doesn't need to come to that, and we don't need to be so narrowly focused in trying to demonize the use of technology that is helping us stay connected during COVID. After all, it's pretty rare for someone's addiction to technology to get quite that bad. So don't let it take over your life, but definitely don't let it stop you from making the most of your favourite apps and digital devices during this difficult and challenging time.

For workers, they can work from home with screen time, while staying with their family.

Education is another area of benefit. Many students can now learn at home via screen time. And universities' distance-learning programs can be supplemented with screen time.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

You're now a young adult, but you're going to die. Now you might be thinking what's the big deal, everyone dies. Remember these people were given a drug that is supposed to grant them immortality. You were too high risk because you were too old. 

The problem is, the people given the immortality drug were sold a bill of goods. The drug didn't actually produce immortality. It doesn't prevent people from aging. It actually does the opposite.

People who are 40 years old look 80. They have wrinkled skin, muscle atrophy and are becoming very forgetful. The scientists simply got this one wrong. This was an experiment after all. There was no guarantee. But the researchers dangled immortality over those young and impressionable adults like a carrot. Most humans would take a drug if they were told they would be immortal if they did so.

How could the researchers get something so wrong? That's a great question. The answer would be greed. The researchers figured that this experiment would go well and they would be sitting on a gold mine. And they were. For about 10 years there weren't any issues. Now the side effects are starting to show and those researchers who are now rich are public enemy number one.

People are throwing bricks at their homes, defacing their property, breaking their car windows and more. The researchers basically exploited the human mind in order to make a huge amount of money. What once was an experiment turned into a business. Again, if there is an immortality drug...there's no price you can pay that would make it a rip off. Immortality is priceless.

I feel horrible for these people. I don't think the researchers did this maliciously. But when it comes to a human beings life, you can't be taking risks and shortcuts in order to profit. Those researchers ended up getting killed by a mob of previous patients. There was no real way to escape. They were the most wanted people in the world. 

This should serve as a life lesson for society. There are always going to be greedy people in this world. People who try to use you in order to profit. People who try to take advantage of you for their benefit.

Then, the wolf tried chemical warfare, with the nerve agents Tabun and Sarin, and they did get into the house, but as it turned out the pig had a full sealed NBC suit on , so the nerve agents had no effect whatsoever on him.

The wolf took a break for a few days and then tried again with a fuel-air explosive. The pig had to turn up his air conditioning as a result, and his electric bills would be pretty high for the next month, but the house still stood.

Exasperated, the wolf spent a few days hunting around for a nuclear device. He found one, but as it turned out,  the seller was running a sting operation , and the wolf was arrested for trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon into a country that had signed the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

As he was hauled off in shackles, he looked over his shoulder at the pig, and glared. The pig smirked back at him, and said , ""Super-hardened structure, 'dude.' Next time,  try using the right kind of bomb FIRST.'

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it. Audiobooks have opened up new worlds for me. I used to be a very slow reader, and I would often get bored with a book and not finish it. But with audiobooks, I can listen to a book while I'm doing other things, and I don't get bored. It helps me to get through books that I might not have finished otherwise. I feel more connected to the characters when I listen to an audiobook, and I feel like I'm really there with them. 
I think listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading it.
 It is less taxing on the eyes. It is less mentally fatiguing to be read to than it is to be alert enough to read. One nice thing about audiobooks is being able to have ones eyes closed. We can listen to music with our eyes closed, but not reading books.  That is one of the most relaxing things I can do. Another benefit  is you can enjoy the sound of the narrator's voice. It is like listening to a friend tell a story and adds the level of entertainment that doesn't exist with reading paper books. Books are silent. In the end, I think audiobooks are just as good as reading. Everyone should try at least one audiobook in their life.

One day, the woman is watching the film Groundhog Day when she suddenly realizes how familiar the situation seems. A character in the film is being wooed by a man who lives the same day over and over, and slowly learns everything about her through all the repeated dates. Meanwhile, the men that the woman has been dating in real life also seem to know a lot about her.

As it happened, the rest of the world had united, recovered from the conflicts of previous decades, and essentially erased all US influence. An era of peace and prosperity had emerged,  and without America constantly stirring the foreign policy pot, even the most malevolent dictatorships had become benevolent democracies.

The planet was clean, global warming had been reversed, and even the poorest countries were developing like never before, in a manner that benefited both human prosperity, and the planet's ecosystems. Tremendous medical and technological advances had been made: there was a cure for every disease, and some steps had been taken towards manned space flight, terraforming, and eventual colonization of other planets in the solar system. In short, the world was a better place without the United States.

The United States government sized up this situation, and an internal debate began; some suggested that the only way to reclaim its former glory would be for America to force its way back to the front of the world stage, while others suggested that perhaps the isolation of 50 years had contributed to a kind of peaceful stability, and that maybe the United States should leave well enough alone, and join in the peace and prosperity, in a more minor role rather than its former status as a superpower. A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse.

The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States. The world observed the US civil war with varying degrees of concern, but ultimately took no action to interfere. They felt that the world was fine without America, and what happened there was of no concern to the global community.

This was a mistake. The Second Civil War raged out of control, eventually leading to the deployment of nuclear weapons, and the US became a nuclear wasteland.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, I think listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading in a majority of cases.  You can still be enthralled listening to a book as you would reading a book.  For certain people, an audiobook is more enticing to them due to the production values of some audiobooks.  For example, the audiobook of the Harry Potter series has a full cast of actors and actresses who read each part.  This can really help people get into the book.  It is almost like you are listening to a play.

If you drive and commute great distances, audiobooks are a great companion to have on the road.  You are able to engage with the book while still keeping your eyes on the road.  This is a great way to multitask.  You are able to make your way through a book while still being on the go.  Audiobooks also provide a way for those who are visually impaired to enjoy a book that may not be available in brail.  This is a great way to make books more accessible to those who may not be able to read the book in its original format.

I would say that one benefit from reading is that you get exposure to words in text form that you may not know the meaning to. I find that this helps me to learn new words more than listening to an audiobook.  Personally, I equally like to read and listen to books.  I will listen to books that have a great narrator.  I will read books that don't have a good narrator.   A bad narrator will ruin an audiobook for me.   

Audiobooks are a great way to enjoy literature.  They have many positives and very few negatives.  I think more people should try out audiobooks because they may discover that they love it just as much as I do.   ",27,7,17,0,3,4,3,1,0,3,0.0,0.6296296296296297,0.1111111111111111,0.4573002754820937

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, schools need to provide pads and tampons to their students as needed. I would suggest keeping a dispenser in each of the girl's bathrooms and locker rooms. The dispenser would be similar to those that dispense soap and paper towels, but it would contain pads and tampons. I dont think the financial cost would be unbearable but the having them freely available at all times would be priceless to the girls. This would effectively end most period shaming and any other embarrassments that may go along with it. It would just be one less thing a young girl needs to worry about and that in itself is worth any trouble since they have enough worries as it is. I personally remember seeing and hearing stories in middle and high school about girls having issues and it haunted them for the rest of their school days.

You ponder in your head why speaking their name would not be allowed, but decide against it. You then speak, "" Are their others who wish to serve as my servants?""
The little bee replies, ""Yes, Your Majesty, there are many who wish to serve you, but I am the first to arrive,.""

Your head begins to fill with many racing thoughts, of what you can do with hundreds, maybe thousands of servants at your command. You then proclaim, ""Tell them to arrive to my quarters, for it shall be their new home.""

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, humanity as a whole need to care more for humans than animals, as a collective specie, humanity should be our top priority. However, I do not fail to understand that for human individuals, their animal friend, or their pets are huge priority to them. This can be in fact, that a particular animal is more important to that individual rather than another human, in which the suffering of an animal can be more important to them than a fellow human.

Take for example a popular celebrity with a pet dog. This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.

This celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.

Caring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.

So yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.

The first thing to do is make sure that we would all survive in the years to come. And how we do that is to first combat climate change, a big thing that is already harming animals and plants on this planet, and look forward to caring for everyone and everything.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should opt for a balance. We should use screens if they help reduce danger of catching Delta Covid. We also need to maintain relationships in real life. While screens did, indeed win, we need to involve ourselves with others in real life. We need to give hugs when it's safe to do so, visit people see them in actuality. We need to keep close connections. Removing ourselves from others damages us. It prevents us from deepening our relationships and cementing our life.
We need to be aware of the dangers of screen time.
 We need to monitor our usage and do what we can to avoid becoming addicted to screens. We need to maintain a strong self control with avoiding being pulled in with gaming, too much texting, and avoiding real events, if it's safe to meet in person. When people invite you over, if it's safe to go, say yes. Take care to change one activity each day. Maintain close friendships, don't neglect to go for a meal with someone, host a game night, or do something fun. Make a sort of game of it. 


If you're feeling isolated, try to get out and about.
 Do something fun, encourage someone who you see in person. While outside, introduce yourself. Make a new friend, in real life. Avoid sitting home alone in the dark. It's a bad sign that you are so focused on a small screen and can't determine what's happening near you. When you are outside try to avoid listening full time to blasting music. Listen to birds, hear your neighbors say hello. Make things more real. Make your life real. Shun the virtual if you can. Do screen free time at work or at home.  For goodness sake if you meet someone or are at work and in a meeting, turn OFF your devices. Be wholly present. 
If you have a child, monitor their screen time.
 Try to be positive and bring about change. It will help your emotional health, the health, emotionally of your family, and your friends.  Make a goal, write it down, with paper, Do it now.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

For the past experiences I have had with dating, I had not used dating apps to do so. The reason is that I had been born before they were created, and before they were both widespread and effective. I have had a few relationships, but they were all with people I knew in person, either through school, work, or other interests I have held. For the most part, it had been a positive experience for me, and I did not have a strong reason to try out dating apps that did become available when I was older. 
I think that technology has improved dating and relationships in a few ways.
 For the most part, technology has made people more connected and engaged with one another, making it easier for them to keep in touch, or to socialize despite the distance we may have with one another, and our commitments to our work or obligations. In the past many had slower means to communicate that was sometimes less personal, like letters, or even phone calls. Since the 90s, the creation of the internet and the adoption of personal cell phones and later smartphones allows people to communicate instantly, via text messaging or through social media. This has allowed people to keep in touch more easily, and to have a more personal connection with one another. Especially so with the improvement of many technology such as video calling via your phone or personal computer, which is a way many can still feel close to others they are romantically involved in. Tchnology has aelped people to meet others, ao find othose ith similar interests or values. to them, and has had other benefits to romantic interactions.
In my opinion, technology has not worsened dating and relationships.
 It has had an overall positive impact on dating, and I do not believe that it will be lessened or removed in the near future. I believe technology will continue to improve and become more effective, which could mean that dating apps will become better at getting people together, for the type of romantic relationship they may want to pursue. In addition, technology has allowed people to be more open and communicative in their romantic relationships, and allows people to share their thoughts with others allowing such relationships to continue and deepen over time. While some might still benefit through not using technology for dating as much as others, the presence of technology ought to be considered in embraced in modern society, in terms of the benefits it offers in maintaining relationships with one another.",25,9,8,0,8,9,8,1,4,4,0.0,0.32,0.32,0.4532520325203252

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, the argument isn't persuasive at all. Student athletes should absolutely be paid for their work on the field or court. The amount of money they make the universities speaks for itself. We're not talking about hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Student athletes make universities hundreds of millions of dollars each year and don't see a cent. Think about an athlete like Zion Williamson. The amount of money that Duke and also the college sports networks like ESPN made off of him alone is in the millions.

The only people who don't want to see student athletes get paid are the people that are exploiting them for money. Think about the student athletes that get a full academic scholarship to school. What are they getting out of being a student athlete? They already have a full ride. They're actually at a disadvantage compared to a student who isn't as good academically.

College athletics is a business. And I consider the student athletes to be employees. If they are the employees, they deserve to get paid. If all of the student athletes went on strike, universities across the world would lose billions of dollars. You know what 99% of the student athletes would lose? Absolutely nothing. 

It's disgusting that because these kids are 18-22 years old that people think they can take advantage of them. Luckily, more and more student athletes have started to speak out about the scam that college athletics are. A bill has already been passed that allows students to get paid for their image and likeness.

When it comes to student athletes getting paid and certain universities having a competitive advantage due to the amount of money they have to spend, you simply set a salary cap like other sports. You could also set a cap on an individual players salary as well. Student athletes are currently making $0 per season. If they were to get paid up to $100,000 per season I don't think any of them would be complaining. That is life changing money for most young adults. 

Until I hear a logical and fair argument about students not deserving to get paid for their performance on the field, I'm never going to change my stance on this. Students are risking injury and in some cases their life to make people in power money. They aren't puppets. They are people.

They are people who work their ass off and put on a great product. They deserve to get paid.  So instead of sitting by while they get exploited, lets use our voices and support them.

In my opinion, science is by far the most important subject a student can learn. Being taught science gives people the tools they need to think critically and rationally. Its teaches students the scientific method which can be applied to all aspects of life. Using this can help you to weed through all the nonsense that has been around for all of time.

If children are taught this at an early age their ability to put what they have learned into everyday life becomes second nature.

One of these is a film about a man who has been reincarnated as a fly. You watch with little interest until you realize that the man is you. You wonder what's going on, were you really a fly in a past life? Or, even worse, is this your fate for the future?!
The film is a comedy, but it has a serious message.
 This is the life you could have lived if you had decided to do something very bad in a previous life. Luckily you made the right choice and avoided the life of a fly. Another preview begins to play. It is the story of a man who has been reincarnated as a dog. You wonder if, again, this dog was you. Sure enough this is a life you could have had in a previous reincarnation. Had you not been bold and followed your dreams you would have been this dog in your last life. Not as bad as being a fly, perhaps, but still not great. Another preview plays. This time you are shown a being of great power living a life of pure joy. You learn that this is the life you could have had if you had fulfilled all of your potential in your previous lives. You are told that you won't actually be seeing your next life as that life is up to you to live.

The 92nd little pig said, ""no, I have not heard that phrase.
 But I don't like the sound of it one bit. I think that you may not be trustworthy.""

The wolf answered, ""Maybe not. But at least I'm not a total jerk."" He walked away, thinking that maybe it was a little mean of him to not tell the pig how dangerous the Uranium was. But that little pig was such a jerk! 
The 92nd little pig was a very patriotic pig.
 So patriotic that he decided he needed to do something about the wolf. He went to the local police station and said, ""I want to report a wolf."" ""And I want to report that his is a danger to the country.""

The police took that kind of thing very seriously. So they sent the 92nd little pig to the FBI. And there the little pig told them all about what the wolf said about the Russian. And he may have added a few other details in, to embellish the story a little and make sure the FBI understood just how dangerous the wolf was.

 The arrested the wolf immediately. ""But, he said, I need to tell you something important! I was just going to tell the little pig that he shouldn't build his house out of depleted uranium!""

""Shut up"" said the FBI agent. None of us, and certainly not this hero of a little pig, are going to listen to anything you say! And the put the wolf in jail straight away.
The 92nd little pig was very pleased with himself.
 Word got out about what a good pig he was, how smart, and how brave. And the townspeople were very proud of him. WHen people came to the pig to hear his story, he always told them about his wonderful Uranium house. Everyone agreed it was wonderful. They all wanted houses just like it, so that they could be like their hero. 

So the little pig started a company that built Uranium houses. And he was very successful. He was very happy. But eventually people started getting sick, and no one knew why. It got worse and worse. Then the FBI agent remembered something the wolf said. He went to the wolf in jail and said, ""I think you were right. Everyone is getting sick. What should we do?""

The wolf said ""Knock all of the houses down right away!"" So they let the wolf out of jail, since he was good with houses, and everyone worked together.

He figured the only way he could eat the pig would be if the pig came out of the house. He would have to trick the pig into meeting him somewhere. The wolf walked down the street. He took out his phone and dialed the little pig's uranium house. There was no answer. The call was forwarded to an answering service.  ""If you would like to leave a message, press 1. If you would like to make an appointment with pig, press 2."" The wolf pressed 2. ""Please hold.""  Down the street, wolf could see the uranium house suddenly light up with multicolored lights. The wolf was confused. He could hear music and laughter coming from the house. He was so curious, he began walking closer to the house. Maybe it was a party.   The wolf walked up to the front door.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

Do we have a moral duty to stay informed? In a democracy, the answer is yes.

In America's earliest days, voting was restricted to middle and upper class property owners because the founders did not trust that the average information-starved citizen could make good decisions. 

And in the past, the news was almost a luxury. But the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath meant that there was technology allowing anyone who wished to stay informed to do so. And as the twentieth century turned into the twenty-first, the amount of effort one needs to get the news has declined until it is now more difficult to avoid the news than to consume it.
TSo te news is not longera luxury.
 Everyone who votes is asked to make a decision that involves knowing what one is deciding between. Uninformed decision-making can cause people to suffer (prisoners, the disabled, immigrants and taxpayers, for example). Since causing suffering is morally bad,  informed voting, which can decrease suffering, is morally good.
But tgehting te news is not just about voting.
 Being successful requires that we know enough of what is going on in the world to make a host of informed decisions. Ignoring the news can be a recipe for, not just political, but personal failure!

So ignore the news at your peril!

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has had a detrimental affect on relationships and dating., for many reasons.  We have lost the art of socializing and communicating face-to-face, which precludes a closer interaction between two people.  Due to unrealistic depictions in modern media, people develop unrealistic expectations of relationships and partner's personalities.  All these apps are about appearance, and have nothing to do with substance.  People spend hours curating a fake image online and attributing a persona that doesn't exist in real life..  Also, the images of their lives that they present on social media are far removed from their actual lives, all you see is the positives, not the negatives.   Then when it comes to meeting them they bare no resemblance to their presentation, either in appearance or what they do.  All of this creates an unreal expectation that cannot be met in real life.  People compare their romantic lives to those on TV and social media, causing increased dissatisfaction and disillusionment.  Dating apps also focus on the appearance over substance, and their is no development of an interpersonal relationship that exists in real life, which I think is vital to a healthy relationship.  People used to get to know each other, at work, in bars, at other social events, now they meet through a virtual world that encourages narcissism over human interactions.  All in all, I feel that our romantic lives have suffered in the digital age, that lack of social interaction is not conducive to growth of personal relationships.  It is too late to turn back the clock, but maybe there is a way to minimize the damage that technology has caused?

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school are how to get along with others, and how to be successful on the job. Few people go on to pursue a job that requires a highly specific degree. Most people just finish high school and get a job. Because of that they really need to learn social skills first. School forces you to be around people you may not like. You are put into classes with people you may not know. The more you learn how to get along with others the better off you will be. That skill comes in handy when it's time to work. You again will be surrounded by people you may not like and you'll need social skills to navigate the situation. 

Second there's the job market. School will show you what things you are interested in and good at. You may learn that you are good at math so you feel comfortable getting an office job where you do paperwork. On the other hand you may learn that you are better at working with people and serving them or being directly around them, such as in a doctor's office. These things you learn in school show you what you'll be good at.

Obviously students need to learn the basic skills to get through life like learning English and basic math skills. From there though it really comes down to just finding out your social skills and the things you enjoy doing. School helps you with those things, it really opens your eyes to many choices so that you can choose the career that fits you and the one you will want to stick with. Since most of us will not get a college degree it is important to realistically view school for what it is. It's a chance to just learn about ourselves and use that to guide us through our work life as an adult.",24,6,13,0,5,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.5416666666666666,0.20833333333333334,0.4418604651162791

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one and there are even situations where it's more beneficial. I love using audiobooks because I can listen to them while I am laying down before I go to bed. I don't want to read in the dark obviously as that would do damage to my eyes.

I also appreciate audiobooks as they allow people who can't read and people who can't see to be able to ""read"" a book. Audiobooks also give me the option of speeding up the reading. So if I'm a poor reader I can get way more accomplished in a specific time period by listening to the book compared to actually reading it.

I also find it very nice that audiobooks tend to be cheaper than physical books, especially the hardcover ones. We live in a digital world and I am fully invested in that. I will say that I do love holding a book for whatever reason. I like feeling the cover and the pages and also looking at pictures that are sometimes in the middle of the book.

However, audiobooks are just more convenient. If I'm on a crowded bus or a crowded train and I have to stand, reading would be very difficult and also uncomfortable. I can put my headphones in and go to an app such as Audible or Chirpbooks and just tune everyone out and get the information from the book that way.

I think there are pros and cons to both methods and also think they are useful in specific scenarios like the one I described above. I just prefer the convenience and the price of audibooks. They fit my needs and wants better when it comes to reading. 

I have read physical books and I have listened to many audiobooks. I love both methods and will continue to use both for the rest of my life.  I prefer audiobooks and think that preference will stay for a while. Especially as the audiobook scene continues to grow and improve technology and app wise.

Instead, Earth is populated by a number of different tribes and clans.  The United States had continued its democratic traditions and technological advancements while in isolation.  It combated environmental issues, done space flights to Mars, perfected self driving cars and many other technologies while the rest of the world had simply gone downhill.
America is therefore a new and exciting place to live, while the rest of the world has become more primitive.
  While border security had been an issue before, now that people throughout the world found out what strides America had made, people started flocking to the borders.  The president, Will Young, wanted to interact with the rest of the world, but knew he had to manage that carefully.  He first had to make sure no one from the outside world could attack America, then he was going to try and open up trade with the rest of the world.  While the US hadn't invested a lot in weaponry during the 50 years of isolation, it still had a strong military and powerful weapons.  He made sure that was known around the world.  He surrounded America with the military to ensure no one could get in or out, while his government started working with other countries to bring trade back.  He was not going to let anyone flood into America and destroy the way of life that had been worked on for the past 50 years.

But then President Young thought back to the days of the Donald Trump presidency, when he had built a wall with Mexico and not shown empathy with those who had good reason to escape their countries.  He challenged his senior staff and aides to create a plan to allow some immigration without detriment to what the US had enjoyed the past 50 years.  He was going to make sure that those entering the US were from countries that were allied with America and who's people would contribute to the country.

Within 6 months, Young's plan was put into place.  Immigrants were considered and many had skills to further advance US interests.  Rather than getting the dregs of other countries, he found he was getting the best of the best.  American continued to advance over the years, and many other countries advanced as well, as the US shared technology and best practices around the globe.

---

In my opinion, I don't think we're being bad citizens by not keeping up with the news. Honestly, so many of us are overwhelmed enough as we are with our day to day life that's it's really impossible to keep up with everything going on around us. I know that for me, my day does not allow me to be checking up on what's happening in the world. I usually have to wake up around 6am, take my children to school, go to work, come back home around 3 or 4pm and then run errands or pick up my ids from their various activities. The thinking goes along the line of ""I like to know what's going on around me, I don't need to know everything."" Besides, I spend a lot time using social media sites, keeping myself super busy with my life and the lives of my loved ones. So what if I don't know or don't care that Russia is openly or covertly annexing parts of Ukraine? So what if I have no idea that a group of gunmen attempted to take over a federal building in Oregon? Or that the MTA is slowly gobbling up money from the city of New York? Or that Madonna has an estranged 16 year-old son? All I really care about is that my family is safe, the weather is warm enough to hang out in the park and that I can get a taco from Dos Toros for lunch. I don't think that makes me a bad citizen, because when it really matters, I will pay attention. For example, when I learned that my favorite subway line was flooded with storm water, I stopped using it for a couple of days. But I'm not going to obsess myself over the news. After all, as long as I'm safe and my family is safe, I don't really care what's going on everywhere in the world. It completely infests your mind and makes you a nervous wreck if you're always on high alert for danger. And moreover, a lot of news is just pointless gossip anyway. For example, people really do make a big deal over Madonna's son. And does Madonna deserve to be shamed because she's not a model parent? After all, her son is a teenager. And only by the grace of God have I been a model parent for my toddler. So honestly, I choose to let a lot of what happens in the world go by, because I feel like it's a distraction from making a better life for myself and my kids and family. 
In short, no, I think that bad citizens aren't people who don't listen to the news.
 I think unplugging from the news can actually make you a better citizen. Some people are so tied to getting their news fix that they feel obligated to follow the news 24/7, which takes up so much of their time and makes it harder for them to engage with things that can actually improve their lives, such as volunteering to help others, for example. I know someone who always had to know where things were on at all times, and it made her more anxious than anything else. She was actually incapable of relaxing, because she felt like she had to keep up on everything. And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from ""life."" Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why should I spend my time reading about her superstar gossip when I have a job and a family to worry about? I just don't see how it's possible that everyone in the world can keep up with all the news and still do things that benefit people around them.",45,6,6,1,32,43,39,4,2,37,0.022222222222222223,0.13333333333333333,0.7333333333333333,0.37447698744769875

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, whether a sport is reasonable or not depends on the purpose, goals and motives of the participants. Those who participate in the sport purely for recreation or adrenaline may promote a rationale for doing dangerous activities like skydiving, rock climbing or ski jumping, But what is the goal of the sport?  What defines winning? What defines losing? How do the rules determine what's fair and what's unfair? It all seems a bit pretentious, even if it's a thrill -- not to mention expensive -- to hurtle oneself off a high cliff or summit if there is not a clearly-defined way of doing it well or poorly, or right or wrong. 
But if the goal of the sport is to achieve a specific outcome that has not yet been achieved, as in trying to travel farther or higher
, that increases the risk of someone getting hurt or damaging something. Reckless and irresponsible behavior is condoned if the consequences are not likely to extend beyond the individual(s) who are participating. Is that selfish when the sport can clearly be categorized as dangerous? I think so. Reckless behavior goes against the concept and principles in sport, which is honor, integrity, fairness and respect. Acting responsibly is something that should be frowned up, especially in competition.  
Sports teach much in the way of values, or principles that can help us to determine how we should live our lives.
 That is why we should aim to label activities as sports only if they promote or sustain the value of sports. Otherwise, it's just a dangerous game. Dangerous games have consequences that must be faced, and I don't want those to taint the idea of what sports are.",20,5,6,0,9,14,10,4,0,10,0.0,0.3,0.45,0.5576923076923077

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. People have the right to stand up for what they believe in. If they want to help animals, then they should. If humans are suffering, more help and services are available than for animals. Humans are able to reach out and find help, but animals don't have that ability.  There are less people ready and able to help animals, which is why organizations are formed to help them. Furthermore, animals cannot speak for themselves, so they need people to speak for them. They are not able to plan ahead and prepare and adapt in emergencies.  Humans have the ability to learn how to help and save animals. Animals don't have that ability to return the favor by saving humans' lives. All in all, I think it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

So the problem of stereotypes in writing won't be fixed, until the problem of bad writers is fixed; the person waiting for that to occur, will be waiting a long time.",19,4,2,1,12,24,19,5,0,19,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.6842105263157895,0.41025641025641024

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, being aware of your surroundings, environment and world is important. You should be a participant, not solely someone who is passively acted upon by politics, current events, and justice.  Being passive and not participating and being aware in news is dangerous.  Regimes and dictatorships thrive on this sort of mind set and it should be shunned. Persons who simply go blindly with the crowd are the sort swept into oppression, misery, and morally bankrupt schemes. Think specifically about cults. Jim Jones, a cult leader made sure his followers couldn't participate in politics, in fact he withdrew them from the United States into a place with no real media or news, Jones Town it was called. Koolaid is what was served to those there.  They also didn't bother to find out about current events. Allowing their autonomy to be given up, families who whispered warnings were ignored. Almost everyone who followed Jones ended up as victims being poisoned or shot, or damaged forever.

We should make sure we follow news, asking questions when appropriate and listening to diverse viewpoints. It allows us to see charlatans who would possess us. It allows us to arm ourselves. The most important weapon that we hold is the vote. We should find out about candidates and policies and vote for those that are fair, just, and bring humanity forward. It's all of our business to participate. It's necessary and a requirement of citizenship that we understand what is going on around us. If we don't act competently we can expect to be herded like cattle.  It is a choice. We should participate in the choice to be informed. We should ask questions if we don't understand.

Are they themselves slumlords who will reap profits off the tears of the poor? Let's find out. We can't make informed choices if we don't know who to listen to and who is telling us the truth. We need information to become informed.

Here's how; Watch news from at least 2 sources. Make sure the choices are unbiased, or as fair as possible. Ask questions, find out something if you don't understand details in the news. Vote, send in the ballot or wait in line to vote after watching the news and researching the candidates, or issues voted on. Check out generic voter guidelines. Ask questions of your local candidates. Attend open sessions where candidates take questions, and listen to what is said there carefully.

""Starlight Makers"" is a magical girl anime series created by the Japanese animation studio, Studio Trigger.
 Essentially, the storyline is that a girl named Soeurette is supposed to woo the leader of the aliens, whose name is Matt. Soeurette, prior to dosing herself with Mana, was a man named Tyler. But now thanks to Mana, she has adopted a very feminine figure, and has become a magical girl. She is thin, has long blonde hair, and wears a very revealing outfit. She is also very tan, and very fit, and is very attractive. 

Soeurette finds Matt on planet Zorg, and they go on a date together. Matt is instantly enamored because of Soeurette's beauty, and the two of them have a good time. Soeurette is very conniving, thanks to her Mana, and she uses her powers to seduce Matt. In bed, the two of them make love. Matt is very pleased, and he thinks that Soeurette is the most beautiful woman he has ever met. The next day, Matt has a meeting with his advisors, and he tells them that he wants to marry Soeurette. His alien advisors are against the idea, because of course, the aliens are trying to take down all of humanity. They cannot do so if Matt is married to a human! But Soeurette knows how to get what she wants, so the next time the two of them make love, she secretly pokes a hole in Matt's condom. She eventually ends up pregnant with Matt's child as a result of this encounter, and she uses this to blackmail him into marrying her. Matt informs his advisors that he has no choice but to marry Soeurette now, because he has impregnated her. His advisors are furious, but they agree that Matt should step up as a father. So, Matt and Soeurette get married, and she moves into the palace with him. They raise their daughter Harper together, and Harper is half human and half alien. 

Soeurette uses her relationship with Matt to save humanity. However, it's for another day to learn what happens in the series when Matt learns what Soeurette did by poking a hole in the condom. He's certainly going to be furious. And that may have untold consequences for humankind that we cannot even fathom at this point.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. I feel this way because there are so many benefits to listening to a book. Listening over reading a book opens up many more opportunities to have a chance to use the book. You can listen while you are cleaning the house, listen while exercising, listen while driving, etc. When you read a book, you are sort of limited to the times you can sit down and relax. Audiobooks seem to be better suit for people who find themselves on the go more, but still would like to indulge in a good book at times. In addition to that, you really are given the key to perfect pronounciation in the book. Sometimes you may be speed reading and pass over a minute detail in the book that you simply missed with your eyes. The audiobook is read to you so you dont have to worry about this ever happening. 
All this being said, an audiobook may not be for everyone. Some people do not like the idea of listening to someone else read the book to them. Some people also just prefer the traditional way of reading as it is a relaxing hobby in general. People could feel that it is easier to immerse yourself into a book when you are reading on your own. I know that our kids do better with assigned readings when they can get the audiobook version. Seems to be easier to break the procrastination when you can simply press play and listen to the book. I am mostly a fan of the audiobooks simply because it allows me to get more done around the house and in my life. I would pretty much always prefer the audiobook over the book personally. I would rather lay down and close my eyes and listen to a book over sitting in a chair with the book open. I can even get up ad go to the bathroom if need be. I also love the ability to listen to the audiobooks when exercising. Going on jogs and listening to audiobooks is much more entertaining than i ever realized.

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. They are both important issues. We should help animals because they are living creatures and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Focus on either group helps improve the world. It's a positive force for change. 

Animals are more helpless than most humans. They cannot speak for themselves, so it is up to us to speak for them. Animals are also more innocent than humans. They do not have the ability to think about what they are doing. They have a purity shared only by human children. 
This innocence provides a clarity. When we help them, we know we are doing the right thing. 

This purity make violence against them wrong most of the time. We have a clear stance, ""this is wrong"", across races, creeds, religions. 
Even religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. 

People probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it. They have spent time with it and have formed a relationship. They have seen it grow and learn. They care about it, while the foreign tourist is an unknown. ""Us vs. Them"" is deeply ingrained in our DNA. 
It is also possible that people are more empathetic toward animals because they have been domesticated.
 They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can. 

Human interactions are more complex. With animal cruelty, it's easier to see wrongs, and right them. This is perfectly fine, a valiant effort on our behalf to make the world better for someone, human or animal.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" He wondered where he got it. Maybe there is some actual good uranium left that he could sell and get rich. Then he wouldn't have to pull these long shifts blowing down the houses of little pigs. 

""Where did you find this uranium to build your house?"" the wolf asked. 
""In my house,"" replied the little pig.


That baffled the wolf. Was this a magic house of some kind? 

""Can I come in and look at it?"" the wolf asked.

The pig was hesitant, then agreed on one condition. 

""You'll leave me alone if I do this. Deal?' asked the pig. The wolf agreed and was allowed to enter.
There was nothing special inside the house.
 The wolf was confused. He looked around and it was no different inside than any other house he had blown down. 
""I'm sorry, but I don't see anything special about this house.
"" said the wolf. 

The pig then pointed to a door and said the source is in there. The greedy wolf quickly walked inside. As soon as he did, the pig slammed the door shut and trapped him inside. The wolf angrily howled and tried to get out, but the uranium door wouldn't budge. He tried huffing and puffing it down but it was no use. The wolf was trapped!

The pig got on the phone and called a wolf rental service. He said he'd need an extra big one because his house was made of uranium. He then began packing his bags.

""What are you doing?!"" screamed the wolf. 

The pig informed him that he actually had just sold the land and needed to have the house torn down before the deal would be finalized. 

""Wrong place at the wrong time I guess."" the pig said to the wolf. 

The pig took his things and left. He went outside and watched as the giant rented wolf came and blew down the house. ",42,6,31,1,4,6,5,1,0,5,0.023809523809523808,0.7380952380952381,0.11904761904761904,0.4844124700239808

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we must embrace the increased use for the time being but still be cautious of our usage. We still need to keep a balance, just less of one right now since so much of our lives can be run from home using all the different communication devices and services. 
IOverall though,  think we should embrace the benefits of our digital devices and use them to their fullest.
 We must be very mindful of our children's but adults should probably try to be as productive as possible using these technologies. We just need to keep ourselves focused on our goals and limit our fun time if or when it starts to hurt our productivity and/or personal relationships. We should also be using this time to explore new digital tools and expand our skill sets. Screen time in one form or another will eventually become an all day even when we start using augmented reality  or virtual reality. So, we should be trying to learn as much as possible about these technologies now and how they can be used to improve our lives. We should also be paying attention to the opposite. What is not working and how we can go about fixing it. Finally, it is my conclusion that adults should use this time to really engage with digital technologies to learn what works and what does not. You just need to be mindful of what you are using your screen for. Dont feel guilty either if you spend an extra hour or two playing games or on social media every once in a great while but as I suggested above, we need to focus more on productivity and expanding our skill sets.

In my opinion, we should ban risky sports like mountain climbing to be called a sports. I'm sure a lot of you disagree, but I think it's too dangerous. Remember the time when gladiators have had to fight to the death? It sure felt like sport at the time, but we as a society have evolved and we have realized that it's not a sport. It's a barbaric act. And I know a lot of enthusiast and ""athletes"" of extreme sports will disagree with me, but I think it's just as barbaric.

First off, the family that the person will leave behind if he or she dies are going to be devastated. There's just no question about it. Remember those duels during the time of our forefathers where the loser would die? Two people draw guns to each other, and if one of them misses, the other one will shoot him. Even if your competition does not attempt to actively kill you, the fact that you are risking your life to do something is just not worth it.

You can also argue that the risk of death is much less than the risk of death in a car accident. You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.

Yet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.

So, for the love of those around you and everyone else that is in your life, please stop risking your life for a thrill. We've lost too much in our society because of Covid.

In my opinion, I think dangerous sports are bad.   People need to realize that everything has a limit. To combine competition and danger is irresponsible. You shouldn't risk your life for the sake of winning. Also, by striving to win, you are encouraging your competitors to risk their lives in order to outperform you. This is not right. This is not sport. I am against competition with risk of injury and death involved. It goes against my beliefs of what sport should be. Furthermore, when winning relies on a risk of injury or death, then it is not even a ""game"" anymore. A true game should be fun and end with a handshake. It is a mutual benefit to both competitors.  I am also against extreme sport athletes getting paid to act irresponsibly. There are people that live careful safe lives and are not rewarded for it.  It sets a bad example.   When someone does something dangerous and gets rewarded for it, imitated behavior will increase. Kids might see athletes doing dangerous things and think it is okay because they saw an athlete do it. There needs to be a limit to what is and what is not considered sport. It is hard to determine that limit because everyone has different interests. Everyone has a different idea of what is too dangerous to be a sport. Someday, we might find out that we went too extreme and crossed the line. Or we might come to agreement before that and we can all play safe. ",26,5,9,0,12,20,15,5,2,13,0.0,0.34615384615384615,0.46153846153846156,0.5454545454545454

In my opinion, the answer to the question of whether or not it is selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing is no. Participating in sports or any hobby is a personal freedom. If you want to climb mountains, then do it.  I think the manner in which a person goes about extreme sports says a lot about their character. For example, if a person is reckless and does not take the proper safety precautions, then they are being selfish. But if the person is careful, prepared, and plans well, then they should enjoy the thrills they seek. Another aspect of extreme sports is the competition. How does one outdo their opponent without getting hurt? I think that is where the line is drawn. There should be no harm done to the opponent or to yourself. But there should be clear rules that define winning and to define what is allowed in fair play. Furthermore, if you are going to pursue a risky sport, then you should be prepared for the consequences. I think that with the right planning and the right safety measures, people should be able to pursue risky sports they love. It's what makes them unique. In the end, it's all about personal freedom.

In my opinion, students should learn skills that will improve their ability to work in the real world. That is, school should emphasize vocational education.  In addition to this, school should have a secondary emphasis on basic education, such as reading and writing, mathematics, foreign languages, and history. As it stands now, students leave school not only without marketable skills, but many of them are also functionally illiterate and innumerate. They also lack a grasp of their own nation's history and the events that have taken place in the world.

These are the things schools, *should* be responsible for teaching. In reality, schools end up spending so much time and energy on non-essential subjects, such as liberal arts, multicultural education, and teaching the ""correct"" way to think about political issues, that they seldom teach students how to succeed in work and life. Students also spend so much time thinking about their social life and worrying about their personal safety, rather than actually trying to learn, that they are too distracted and demoralized to learn very much of whatever their teachers arbitrarily decide to emphasize.

I base this on my observations of the young, who I believe are getting a worse education than I did as a member of the previous generation, but also my own experiences. As it turns out, I learned very little in school in the conventional sense. My parents taught me to read and write; friends taught me how to do math;  and I spent copious amounts of time in the library and with our Encyclopedia Britannica, learning about history.

Much of what I did learn in school, involved dubious socialization, self-defense, and wrong-headed political opinions, all of which were 'learning' that I could have done without. So I'd like to spare other students the same useless and even counter-productive 'education' that I had to endure.

Schools should be safe places that students can go to learn essential job skills and basic knowledge,  not places where they're targets of criminality, indoctrinated, and taught to hate and fear others. Sadly I fear,  the latter is more likely than the former, and far from improving from my days in public school, it's actually getting worse.",21,6,1,1,13,25,19,6,0,19,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.6666666666666666,0.5373831775700935

In my opinion, the most important things for children to learn in school have to do with common sense and helping others. I have noticed with my 3 children, that they are no longer learning the basic things in life that we were taught. How to manage finances and type properly and simple life skills are no longer in use. Schools are so often only teaching to the test, so to speak, to achieve high scores on standardized testing and thus obtain funding. This is not only a disservice to the students, but to the rest of the population that will have to live with these young people in the real world. 

Aside from basic life skills, like banking and computer literacy, I think students need to learn how to help others and give freely of their time. I see the youth today as a selfish group of people. They are so tuned into the celebrities and popularity because of social media, that they don't see how the world really is until they actually exist in it by themselves. I have heard recommendations that all students in college should have to do mandatory volunteer work prior to graduation, and I think this should be a requirement for high school students, as well. There are so many organizations that would benefit from the time and efforts of our young people. The giving freely of yourself is a two way street. To see the plights of so many different people and organizations may help to create a more compassionate and understanding society. 
These smart phones and application have distracted from the real world, which I think is a very sad experience.
 When our youth strive to be an influencer or look for an easy way to make money, they are missing out on who they really could be. I know that parents ultimately have the responsibility for raising compassionate and empathetic children. When kids are spending 7 plus hours a day over 200 days in a classroom, however, some of the responsibility needs to fall on the schools. 

Obviously students need to continue to learn grammar and math and science. It is simply needed to have these classes so we aren't a completely ignorant nation. And to give groundwork to further education. However, teaching how to get along by yourself for simple adult tasks like banking and using a computer proficiently, would help these people to become self sufficient. Most students are graduating high school when they are 18, and these simple life skills are a need to survive in the world adequately.  On top of that, being a useful compassionate person who understands the importance of giving will enrich these children's lives and enrich the lives of those they have contact with after they are out of their sheltered school environment.

They had survived, but there weren't many of them. And the environment, terrain, the whole world had been nearly destroyed before the aliens got what they wanted and left. 
The survivors had to learn to live with the new world they found themselves in.
 Unfortunately most of their higher level scientists had perished. And even the tech, and other skilled workers that remained were too few, and the infrastructure they were used to working in was destroyed. 
They had to rebuild from scratch.
 And it did not go well at first. There began to be the general feeling that humanity would decline and go back to the Medieval ages at best. 
But then, a few people began to notice something.
 The old symbols of magic that had long been kept as ancient curiosities and good luck charms began to work again. Fire was easier to start for those carrying fire charms. People with health charms didn't get sick. And so on. 
It was a slow process, but the survivors began to realize that they were no longer completely helpless.
 They began experimenting, and new job types were created. The scientists that were left studied the phenomena, and concluded that they couldn't figure out where the power was coming from, but they were pretty sure everyone had access to it to a greater or lesser degree. 
And so, the survivors began to rebuild.
 Maybe it was the use of magic, or maybe the thought that they were going back to the Medieval ages was in the back of everyone's mind. But the survivors began to rebuild in a very different way.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide these items to the female students. I haven't experienced this myself, but I have been in situations where I had to ask a fellow student for a pad. The only thing the schools have had available for decades (from when I was a teen to now when my daughters are in school) are the cheap, crappy large pads. These are really inappropriate for young girls since they don't fit well in their underwear.   think it's important for girls to have the option of using a pad that fits well and is comfortable.
 A lot of the female population are in sports, and trying to run or work out with the large pads the school provides can be really uncomfortable and embarrassing when others can see the bulky item.

 think that the school should provide tampons as well.
 Not every girl likes the feel of a pad, and I think it is like wearing a diaper. There should be options for the students depending upon preference. These aren't luxury items, here. They are basic things that the female students should have access to without having to leave class with a bloody emergency, or go to the office to beg the nurse for the item. 
I think that the school should provide these items because it is a basic necessity for the female students.
 Everything costs money these days, and honestly, some students simply don't have anything extra in their families. It really isn't about handing these out in bulk, but having the school provide them for emergencies or when a student begins her period on a day she didn't expect to. It is inconvenient to have to search out an adult to get a feminine product, and awkward when all you can find are male teachers. Most of the athletic coaches are my girls' schools are men, and both of my daughters have called me to bring them pads because they were too embarrassed to ask the coach for one. There should be no reason that this is happening.

The only way these items are different is that the male students don't need them. Not sure if that is the reason they still aren't readily available or not. It does make me wonder if the boys needed these items, would they be in abundance? I absolutely think these items should be required by school. Giving the girls tokens of some sort if the school wanted to keep a machine in the girls bathrooms and locker rooms would be an idea. Each girl could get a certain number of tokens every month to access the machines and get what she needed. I have been to schools where there were pad and tampon machines in the girl's areas, but they cost a quarter to purchase. Honestly, what student is really carrying around change to buy these?

This is a basic need that females have to deal with every month. It already sucks enough without having to go and beg for a pad or tampon when you are having a crisis and bleeding in your underwear.

The Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, sometimes it just seems that animals tend to have a kinder more open nature than people. This is why to lose an animal can be one of the saddest things a person can experience. I have had many pets in my life and I know that they can be a great source of comfort and love. They are innocent and what they do is based mainly on instinct and survival, not fear and greed like many humans. For this reason, many people are more outraged when someone could harm such an innocent creature.  think that if we could all learn to be more like animals, then the world would be a better place.
 Another reason I believe people focus on animal welfare is because they are less likely to be a threat to humans. People aren't threatened by a cat the way they are by say a backstabbing friend or a jealous husband. It's really hard to want to do harm to a creature that doesn't even think that way. 
One of the main reasons I think its okay to still focus on animal welfare even when humans suffer is that much of the suffering of animals is actually caused by humans. We are the ones who are responsible for the slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and entertainment. Many people, myself included, feel a great debt to society over the way animals on Earth have been treated. We are the ones who have caused them to suffer and we should be the ones to help them. I also know a lot of individuals who, like me, have pets that they consider part of their family. I care more about my cat than a stranger and see them as equals in a way. While some may disagree, there are enough people who see pets as family that it has become a part of our culture that we can form bonds with animals in this way. 
In conclusion, I think many are just more empathetic to the plight of animals because they relate to them in only a loving way as the animals are innocent. And I don't think it's wrong to focus on animal welfare just because humans are also suffering. They are both worthy causes that can coexist. ",25,7,13,0,5,7,6,1,1,5,0.0,0.52,0.2,0.45233265720081134

He then looked outside but saw nothing except the rods positioned evenly around his home. They did not seem to be active in any way so he turned up the AC and made some lunch.
After lunch the little pig noticed that the house was getting hotter and hotter.
 It was becoming unbearable. Finally the little pig yelled out the window and told the wolf to stop whatever it was that he was doing to heat the house but the wolf was relaxing by the lake far from the the piggy's home.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, in school young people should learn how to think. What I mean by this is they need to understand basic concepts which is fine but they need to be able to really understand the basics such as Scientific Method, which enables them to use this frame work to study things and evaluate information. Just because someone says something is true, for instance, doesn't mean it is. Critical thinking and scientific understanding hold up society and propel learning forward.

Being able to reason, understand facts, and make discoveries on their own are helped by these basis. Scientific method, Critical thinking, and independent thinking are excellent basis for all sorts of different lives. These include people who are scientists, political persons, Factory engineers, Computer programmers, and social scientists. Economics, math, and all sorts of reasoning need this basis, the basis of being able to reason, to work an equation, to figure and juxtapose different ideas onto different frameworks.
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think.
 Reasoning and logic are philosophical, Scientific, mathmatical, Economic, and touch all aspects of life and business.  Being able to get confidence in ideas is also part of mastering thinking skills. The idea that making an error or coming up with an erroneous thought as being bad is also wrong. Thinking means adopting your ideas with changes in facts, changes in the world, and living life.  Admitting your wrong is more important than holding out because you were simply told something. Understanding and adapting are part of thinking and necessary for children to learn in school.
I think this will help my success in the future because I will be able to adapt to new situations, understand new ideas, and reason through
, it also helps young people who are in school. It's important that they learn the basic building blocks of thought. Learning what is possible, what can be done if they try is helped by learning the scientific method. Ask why, ask Why not? Ask how. All questioning is good, answers are better. Learning things is a life long journey and young people should be armed with strong reasoning skills. The Scientific method of understanding how to test theory, how to prove processes is helpful here.

Support young people as they learn, ask and answer their questions. Support inquiry and help people when they have reasonable questions. Schools should support this. It's important and the way forward.",32,6,24,0,2,4,2,2,0,2,0.0,0.75,0.0625,0.4807692307692308

I love listening to audiobooks, and they are a part of my weekly routine. With my commute, I listen to a lot of books, and I can’t imagine giving that up. 
There are a lot of great things about audiobooks.
 The obvious perk is that you can enjoy a book on the go, in the car, or while walking. This is a great benefit, especially when you think of how much time we spend in the car or on public transportation. 

Audiobooks are more ecofriendly. Since they are digital, you don’t need books to be manufactured, stored, and transported. There is also less book waste. Regular books can mold, mildew, and spoil, but audiobooks are forever.

Audiobooks can be used in environments that would damage regular books. They are be listened to at the beach, where regular pages would get sandy or wet.  They can be used when cooking, when your floury hands wouldn't be able to turn a page. 
I feel like I am free to do other things while listening to an audiobook, like rcook clean, or cdo household chores
 I don’t need to focus on a story as much as I would with physical books. I can daydream and do other activities. 

t’s also nice not to have to sit still.
 I feel like I can consume a book while running on the treadmill, or in other places where it’s hard to sit.  
I can be energized by hearing a motivational book while working out. 

I listen to books when I am in bed at night. It’s my time to unwind and give my brain some time off after the chaos of the day. And, thanks to technology, I can keep the volume low while falling asleep. 

Audiobooks have many advantages, and their flexibility makes them valuable, useful, and my preferred way to gain knowledge.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves. 

The third and most important reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would change the nature of college sports. I've always personally found it more exciting to watch college sports than pro sports because I know the athletes are doing it for the love of the game and are maybe even more passionate about it. 

All in all I think it wold be best for college athletes to not be paid because it would change the nature of college sports and take away the fun of it.",20,9,6,1,4,7,5,2,1,4,0.05,0.3,0.25,0.5011933174224343

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we all have a responsibility to keep up with the news. We need to know the news to know what is going on in our world, country, state and town. I think there are some events that are so big even if you don't want to watch or hear about the news, it's impossible to avoid it.

The coronavirus is a great example of that. Everyone was talking about it. Friends, family, television shows, politicians. It was everywhere. And that is reason enough to follow the news. 

I don't think it makes you a bad citizen if you don't follow the news. Some people want to avoid news stories at all costs and I understand that to an extent. That doesn't make them a bad citizen, but it does make them ignorant to the news. I don't even think that's a bad thing. Sometimes ignorance is bliss as the cliche says.

I think engaging in current events can make a difference. At a local level there could be something such as a blood drive that you can see on the news. You then go to donate blood and could possibly save someones life. The news can also tell us about traffic that is caused by car accidents so we know to avoid that road on our way to work.

I like to watch the news because I like to be up to date with everything. It also can help me start up or jump into conversations. The more you know, the easier it is to socialize with others. 

I think the news became much more of a polarizing topic ever since Donald Trump called the mainstream media out for promoting fake news stories. I think that has hurt the trust factor between the people who are giving the news and the people who are receiving the news. They don't know what to trust. 

I will continue to watch the news and I won't judge others if they prefer not to. Do what works for you.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is the American democratic system and how it works. I think this is the most important thing because the system affects all of our lives in a direct way, and we should know who does what and why. We have seen the result of ignorance about this system in many peoples' belief that Trump won the election and that he will be reinstated as President.

First, the belief that Trump won: regardless of how much direct knowledge of the voting process one has, it is beyond doubt that the courts have reviewed over 60 lawsuits alleging fraud and have dismissed or ruled against every single one. The Supreme Court did not choose to reverse any of those rulings. In our system of government, the matter ends there. Only persons ignorant of the constitution could think that there is still a way to reverse the election results.
Secondly, the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President is based in ignorance of the United States Constitution.
 There is no ""reinstatement clause,"" and anyone who thinks there is, again, is ignorant of the Constitution upon which the US government is based. Although there is an impeachment process (with which Trump supporters should ne familiar, their candidate having been impeached twice) for removal of an official from office, that process requires a majority vote in the House and two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 

So the belief that Trump will be reinstated as President only serves to highlight the ignorance of the people who hold it.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is every bit, if not better than reading an actual book for many reasons. he first and most obvious is that listening to audiobooks generally requires less attention.
 I don't know about everyone else, but as far as I'm concerned, reading lines on a page can make my eyes tired and my mind wander. When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax. Audiobooks allow me to enjoy the experience of a book without having to exert the energy of holding a book up or strain my eyes that are tired from looking at a screen all day. All in all there so many benefits of listening to audiobooks that it is just as good, if not better than reading an actual book.",23,7,11,0,5,6,5,1,3,2,0.0,0.4782608695652174,0.21739130434782608,0.5013623978201635

In my opinion, people personify pets, they anthropomorphize them. So dogs and cats might as well be a person with a history, personality, and relationships. They are considered part of the family so I do understand why people would choose their pets 40 percent of the time over a strangers life. However, we have the financial capacity and the capacity to care enough about both issues. This should not be an either or, it should be a both. The world is both full of people problems and animal problems. We need to prioritize them to reduce the most suffering on both sides. The conditions of people and animals are not separate so when one is doing well the other is usually doing well. Pets have also been bread over the years to get cuter and for humans that means resemble children with their big round eyes and small facial features. We look at a puppy and part of us unconsciously thinks of a young child. We then want to nurture and protect it. This is one of the main reasons we are so overly empathetic to the suffering of our pets but not so much animals in the wild. We need a comprehensive plan to increase the well being of both humans and animals. A healthy human civilization could end up saving many more animals then it uses if we, ourselves can get our act together. Choosing between the two would be an reckless at best.

The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the ""Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

Your body initially begins to break down and liquefy. The flesh starts peeling off of your bones and the blood begins to run backwards through your body, until you finally melt into a puddle. Obviously you feel terrible for all of these poor souls who basically signed up for an experiment. There were risks and sadly the risks were more serious than anyone had thought.

These people wanted to live forever and instead are going to die a terrible death. Ultimately the experiment guarantees that the people will live a long life. They won't die before the age of 85. However, they all will go through the same death where their flesh peels off their bones. 

It brings up an interesting debate. Would you rather live a pretty long life but have to suffer a horrific death or just deal with fate? Some people will benefit from fate, some won't. But ultimately it's an interesting concept. Immortality is something that everyone wants. We all want to live forever. The fact that the science isn't ready for that yet shouldn't be surprised. But those people 26 and under fully believed that they would be immortal. After all, that's the entire reason why they were taking the drug.

Those people are now going through a crisis. A life filled with anxiety and panic. There is nothing they can do. They know what is going to happen to end their life and when. That has to be a very scary thing to deal with. It's like having a death sentence on you and not being able to do anything about it. 

The scientists tell the public that the drug had a shelf life they didn't previously know about. It only lasts for 60 years. Their testing wasn't done well enough. The technology just didn't work out the way that they were seeing over their short term research. The scientists were only able to test the drug for a few hours and they believed that it was going to be safe forever.

I would consider that medical malpractice. I am thanking my lucky stars that I was 28 at the time. I would never take a drug like that no matter how good it would make me feel for 50 years.

---

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

There are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.

Computers and phones are here to stay. Many jobs will require emailing, talking or texting, entering data, observing charts and screens multiple times a day. It is an unescapable part of adult life. 

American adults need to worry less about our own screen time and more about letting children sit alone on screens all day. We need to let them enjoy the company of their friends online, talk to them about the huge amount of bullying and meanness in the virtual world too. And we need to talk to them about staying safe in this virtual world. But we need to be reasonable. They need to balance screen time with spending face-to-face time, enjoying the outdoors, and actually participating in activities, instead of watching them. 
Wust how much screen time is too much screen time?
  t's all a matter of balance.
 It's not just the amount of time that matters, but also what you're doing with your device. Spending time on screens might be a problem if the child is using a device to escape from the things around them or if they are ignoring their family. Screens can make you feel more isolated from your surrounding. And when you're depressed, spending more time on screen might even make things worse. 

Screen time can be useful, to learn new things,  talk with family and friends, and enjoy innocent entertainment. Once you have a good balance of activities around screen time, it isn't bad. There is a lot of evidence that video games improve hand-eye coordination and sharpen the reaction time. 

We should balance our screen time with set activities. Every hour, take a walk outside for 10 min. Play with your dog. Hug your loved ones. Vacuum. Wash the dishes. Have the kids help us, and in doing so, we'll set an example of balance they can use for the rest of their lives.

She had always disliked the movies anyway, and now she was stuck here, with a movie she had no control over. With ""herself""? Nope. Not what she had been hoping for. 
As the movie went on, Jane found herself not really watching.

The older woman frowned. ""But we are all so different, just look at us."" 

Jane looked at her, and thought about it. ""Yes, but that is the outside. And anyway, isn't the whole idea to grow and change, and learn? Maybe that is the point? To learn? About ourselves? What we can do or be better?"" 

Jane was surprised to realize that she felt excited and alive again. She grabbed the older woman's hand. ""How about we watch the movie together, and see what else we can learn? Together, as one""

In my opinion, I’d support efforts to provide feminine hygiene products in schools. Feminine hygiene products are necessary. They’re part of a basic need, like food and shelter. Some students might not know what to do if they need one. They might feel alone and isolated and not know who to ask. Having them in a vending machine is not good enough. They should be easily accessible to all students at no charge. Some students just can't afford to buy them. They are at risk of embarrassing situations. Having them available and easily accessible gives students peace of mind. They might be less likely to opt out of sports and other activities because they’ll be more comfortable but having them provided to students for free increases their likelihood of participating in sports and group activities. They need to be easily accessible and conveniently located, and offer privacy and discretion.  Students should feel empowered and independent when it comes to feminine hygiene product use.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

I don't strongly believe that it is wrong of people to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Humans giving attention to animal suffering does not mean that they or others are giving less attention to human suffering, and in general many of the suffering that affects animals was in part caused primarily by human intervention. For example, humans have destroyed and disrupted many ecosystems around the world, making many animals endangered, and countless others extinct. In addition, humans have hunted many, domesticated others, and primarily see animals as expendable and necessary to be consumed for human benefit. Thus, I feel it is understandable that people will emphasize more with the suffering of animals, as they will feel in part guilty of the actions of humanity as a whole, and saddened by the fact that many animals are ultimately powerless against the actions of humans. 
That being said, I think there ieffectivelynis o rule that ydictates you mustfonly ocus on acnuses that aim to reduce aimal suffering if humans are suffering, just as there is no rule
 stating you can only focus on eliminating human suffering. People should be generally concerned with all suffering that exists in the world, hopefully by understanding the pain and suffering that animals are going through, but how they go about investing their time is a more complex matter. For some people, it might be more beneficial or a more efficient use of their time to dedicate many hours to aiding a poor family in an impoverished community than say, going and doing some small volunteer work at an animal organization, while others can have alternative experiences. If many work towards a cause, it becomes more likely that the cause is successful. It is then up to a person to chose how they invest their time in the causes they are aware of, and believe in. 

Overall, it is understandable that people will emphasize with the suffering of animals, who they deem are powerless and unable to better their situation, than the suffering of humans, whose issues tend to be much grander in scope, and requiring more resources and time to resolve. There might also be a psychological phenomenon at play, where people feel that the suffering of animals is much more obvious compared to that of humans, which might be subtle and not easily disclosed. I would also like to add that there is no reason you should have to choose one cause over the other, as both involve complex issues, and might be connected. As long as people as a society work towards both, it is possible given time that the suffering of humans and animals will be eliminated, improving the welfare of both significantly.",20,7,7,0,6,7,6,1,4,2,0.0,0.35,0.3,0.45

The most important thing I learned in school was how to have empathy and compassion. And my first lesson was in the summer after fourth grade.

I was a lonely, bookish kid. I had very few friends and the summer stretched out before me a relentless and boring juggernaut. I was a voracious reader, but I had read everything in the house. I biked over to my school building. It was Catholic school taught by brothers, nuns and priests. I was a little nervous about being there, but I thought I might be able to read in the library.
I walked into the library and was greeted by a t ray-haired, slightly stooped man named Brother Thomas Aquinas. He welcomed me in. He was kind and gentle, and seemed to instantly get why I was there.

My father, an alcoholic, was seldom home and I had very little experience of a male parent. I had no idea what to expect from a father figure. That summer, Brother Aquinas gave me something I had been missing. He gave me a sense of what it was like to have a father.

We settled into an easy companionship, and I spent most of the summer in that library, while my mother thought I was out torturing insects with the neighborhood sociopaths.
Brother Aquinas was a great storyteller.
 He told me stories about the saints and the lives of the great philosophers. He told me about the great thinkers of the world, and about the great thinkers of our time. His empathy and compassion  toward me made me want to have those qualities too.

I will never forget something he said to me near the end of the summer, I had asked him if he thought he would go to heaven. ""I wouldn't want to go to heaven,"" he said, ""unless everyone I loved could be there with me.""

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then they will lack the same ability when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession they are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents who think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is effective because it destroys your so-called social life. 

At school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday, like how it should be done in the real world. This will make them better prepared for their future life.

As a conclusion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. ",22,6,8,0,8,10,9,1,4,5,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.36363636363636365,0.46944444444444444

We transmitted all of his movies to space using a frequency that we thought the aliens could pick up.  The aliens would then fall in love with Matt Damon and want to kidnap him.

We taught Matt the basic grammar of the alien language.   Just enough to survive.  Through the earthling's surveillance, we realized that the aliens are lead by one hive mind.  It is located in one of the space ships that the aliens were using.  We also found out that the aliens were deathly afraid of mercury.  For some reason, mercury can cause the aliens to shrivel up and die.

We told Matt to always keep a syringe filled with mercury on him.   If he is ever in close proximity to the hive mind, he could sneak up behind it and inject it with mercury.  When he was taken by the aliens, Matt was as ready as he ever would be.

When Matt was kidnapped, he was taken directly to the hive mind.   It was alien protocol that all new visitor's must touch the hive mind.  The hive mind would then read the thoughts of the visitor.  When Matt got close to the hive mind, he took out his syringe full of mercury and injected it into the hive mind.  The hive mind shriveled up and died instantly.

After the hive mind died, all of the other aliens started to shrivel up too.  Matt Damon saw escape pods behind the hive mind.  He ran and dived into the escape pod and closed the hatch.  He hit a green button that he assumed would launch the pod.  It did.  The pod detached itself from the space ship.  The controls in the pod were easy for Matt to use.  He was able to steer the ship back onto earth.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

Refusing to pay college athletes rests on a romanticized view of amateurs in sports that has been untrue for over 50 years. Athletes give up a great deal of their time and freedom to appease the irrational exuberance of fanatical, undereducated audiences. In exchange for this they receive a piece of paper with negligible economic value, along with the opportunity to compete in an arena that will guarantee them very little.

The most important consideration here is that college athletes, by virtue of the participation in sports, risk career-ending injuries every day. It's not fair that if that injury happens during their first years as a pro, they probably get millions, but if it happens during their college years, they get nothing. And what do they have to show for it? A diploma and little else.

Paying college athletes ensures that if their career meets a catastrophic end, they are paid enough to partially compensate them for the risks they took--because their college have been profiting handsomely from their efforts. College football has a $1.25 billion annual haul. And the players deserve a piece of that huge pie. They have made it possible.

It's true they may get a diploma, but first, not all of them do, and second, very few players were recruited because of their academic prowess. They probably joined the college football team just to be on a sports team. And so the rewards they receive should come from the sports program of which they are a part.
Quite simply, our colleges have recognized the value of these players and have made them into valuable commodities.
 So why not pay them?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, to fully absorb a book you need to read it.  You can't get the full effect of a book by listening to it.  There are some positives to listening to a book, such as being able to listen to a book while doing other things, being able to listen in places where you could not read, such as being in the car, or being able to listen to a book when you are too tired to read.  However, all of these things point to the reason it is better to read a book.  To get the most from a book, it needs your fully attention, the things that make listening to it attractive also mean you are not fully engaged, you are doing other things that need some of your attention.   I believe if you listen to it, some of the content passes you by, you miss out on some of the finer details and you miss the nuances that make a book great.  Listening is useful, and a pleasant past time, but it is not the same as reading.  So while you can enjoy an audio book, you will not get the same experience as you would from reading the book.  That experience allows you to gain more from the written text and understand what the author is conveying.  So, in conclusion, I believe it is better to read a book than listen to it.",17,7,4,1,5,17,8,9,1,7,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705882,0.35294117647058826,0.4425087108013937

In my opinion, Math is by far the most valuable subject to be learned in school. So much so that they teach it from grade school all the way into deep college levels of math. Math is very important because it teaches you the ability to problem solve in different ways. You also learn about numbers and how they work together to form systems that gives you the ability to come up with extremely creative, diverse, and complex ways to solve many issues.

Math is at the core of everything from science, engineering, and business. Math is a universal language, even if two people don't speak the same language dialect. The language of Math is universal on all groups of people in the world. Some even say it could be the universal language if we ever met extraterrestrials as well. Math can help you understand things you never even knew about.

In my main career of investing and business, I use math everyday to great effect. It helps me and others like me to no end. We could not run a business, or invest wisely without it. A wise investor once said, ""If you don't learn math you're destined to be a loser."" It has saved me a lot of money in the investing world in the long run, because investing isn't gambling... it's a numbers game. If you have the numbers on your side, you win in the end even in times of drawdown or a rocky market environment. It's not guessing, it's working with the statistics and probabilities.

Another benefit of math is that it cultivates an important discipline, which is patience, as well as it is like lifting weights for your brain. The more you do it, the stronger and faster you mind will get. Do not underestimate the power of math, because everyone uses it everyday.",24,6,10,0,8,9,8,1,0,8,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.5345744680851063

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the drug causes those who have been taking it for several decades to develop tentacles which have a mind of their own. The tentacles prefer to live in the ocean, but they can live on land as well. As a result, the tentacles take every opportunity to try to bring the host  closer to the ocean. For example, when the human hosts are asleep, the tentacles take over. They do things like walk to the ocean and order tickets on the neuroweb for the hovertrain to the nearest beach. 
The tentacles are also very good at convincing the host to do things that are good for the tentacles, but not necessarily good for the host.
 Using a telepathic link, the tentacles tell the hosts how fun it would be to to live on a houseboat or in a house on stilts directly over the ocean. They also fill the hosts' brains with ideas that they should spend as much time as possible in the water, even if they don't like swimming.

Since the tentacles work together, it falls to the remaining members of the Lost Generations to protect those who were treated with the drug. Although they are elderly, medical science has advanced and many are in fairly manageable health. They are also very motivated to protect the younger generation from the tentacles.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, there should be a balance of emotional, social and physical interaction online as well as offline. I don't think it's necessary to go full Luddite on the Internet, saying we should do away with Facebook and mobile devices. Some parents are considering this for their families, but it could lead to isolation, loneliness and even depression for kids, who are using social media to stay connected with their friends. Frankly, that's totally counterproductive. At the same time, we can't squander our digital lives on mindless games and social media, which the research shows is the main reason too many of us spend too much time on the Internet. And there are plenty of people who would be better off unplugging completely. For example, some people get sucked into their digital lives to such a degree that they lose out on things we may now take for granted--a night out with friends, time for relaxation and unwinding, reading a good book, heck, even going on vacation.

While our screens are addicting, there's nothing inherently wrong with using them in the right way. And, indeed, for some people, the Internet can be a real lifeline. For example, a recent scientific study shows that a slight increase in Facebook use can actually be a good thing for people with disabilities--if it's used in a healthy manner. This is because this social network lets people with disabilities communicate with others who are similar, at a time when they might otherwise feel alone in their social world. I have a friend named Soeurette, who was born with cerebral palsy. Soeurette uses Facebook to communicate with other people in her situation--something she wouldn't be able to do if social media doesn't exist. Soeurette always says  ""Thank God for Facebook,"" because, without it, she would feel a little more alone in a world of able-bodied people. So I'm always mindful of her viewpoint and that it's perfectly OK to balance screen time with face-to-face, real-world interactions. 
My niece, Everly, is a great example of how that balance can work.
 Everly is a typical nine-year-old girl, with an Internet-savvy iPhone and an iPad 2. She usually spends a little time on each of these gadgets each day. Her favorite apps are games, which are understandably popular with kids her age. But a recent study shows that Everly's screen time is still well within recommended limits. She hasn't forgotten how to play with dolls, act out stories or read books. In other words, she balances her time between the ""real"" world and the digital one--and that's a good thing. 
So what's the best way to achieve a healthy balance?
 With my kids, we've found that we need to start with a chat about how we can be better digital citizens. I always tell my daughter Harper that being a good citizen of the Internet means that she should use her technology responsibly. It also means that she shouldn't spend too much time on her devices--not because technology or the Internet are bad, but because life is about more than just Facebook. Harper and her brother, Bryson, get it; they know that many things in life--and especially life online--are about balance. That's why our family doesn't have hard limits on Internet usage, but still encourages smart use of technology--such as putting away devices for dinner. And on weekends, we always allow some unplugged time for family fun, be it on the golf course or playing sports. Oftentimes, we'll grill together for supper, just the four of us. Everly loves grilling with her dad, because it's a shared family-time experience. And Bryson just enjoys eating the boneless buffalo wings I make for him, which are as big as his head. So there's the balance I was talking about earlier--social time with family, physical recreation, even a little bit of time spent cooking.

In conclusion, I don't think we need to be too concerned about screen time, as long as we're using it in moderation. ",39,6,4,0,29,41,34,7,2,32,0.0,0.10256410256410256,0.7435897435897436,0.45050761421319796
1093,87958a503957482fa3a5b13de3fbb296.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, this is a personal preference and should be left up to each individual. ome people are willing to risk serious injury and even death for the sake of a thrill adventure., and others are not. Since these activities involve so much physical exertion, strength, and skill, they absolutely should be considered sports. I would go so far as to say they are much more of a sport than something such as golf or curling. 
For the people who do enjoy extreme sports, there are some precautions that should be taken to ensure they remain safe.
 As with any activity in life that involves a modicum of risk, people have to be careful and follow recommended guidelines and safety protocols that have been developed to mitigate injury. Most people that participate in extreme sports, have been doing so for a great portion of their lives. They have followed others who perform these sports and are up to date on what safety measures are in place to protect themselves.  urthermore, those who wish to engage in these sports need to consider the risks they are willing to take and determine whether those risks outweigh the satisfaction
 they get from participating in these activities. As I stated, it seems to be a matter of preference. 

I believe that one of the ultimate goals of any sport should be to remain safe and injury-free, and not only while you are participating in the sport, but also if you are teaching it to others. This is why proper safety gear is required when participating in a sport, such as helmets, knee and elbow pads, wrist guards, and other support gear. If someone chooses to ignore regulations for safety, that comes back on them as an individual and shouldn't be a black mark against the sport as a whole. Many people participate in extreme sports because it's exhilarating, fun and a great way to challenge yourself. 

If we were to state that extreme sports shouldn't be called a sport because they are too dangerous we are setting ourselves up to make a similar statement against firefighting or police work as a profession. I know that may seem a poor comparison, but these things would have to be considered. Once we place limitations of people's free time and what they can or can't do, other things will start to follow suite. To that end, can motorcycles be considered safe transportation. Or could we question the safety of going faster than the speed limit.

1094,825d93ee72ec4f8390286a45eca1a2a6.jsonl,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the reasoning that existed before the pandemic should still apply. Namely that screen time should be monitored, and that limiting your screen time is best for both mental and physical health. 
The science shows that too much screen time contributes to obesity, diabetes and hypertension.
 It can cause eye strain, disrupt your mental state, and alter your sleep patterns. That last one is very important, as uninterrupted sleep is an absolute requirement for fighting viruses and to speed up our healing responses. If there is one good thing that has come out of the pandemic it is increased awareness of health, and a new focus on maintaining and improving health. Limiting screen time is an important part of this. 

This is not to say that we should give up on screen altogether. They are an important tool for work efficiency, social connection, and overall entertainment. The main point is a balance must be found.
Do you think you're spending too much time on your screen?
 Then you probably are. Like anything else, technology can become excessive and unhealthy if not properly moderated. Exploring other alternatives in cases where screen related activities have taken over can help you learn where screens are essential to you, and where you could give them up (or use them less) for alternatives. 

In short, studies have shown that screen time can affect you physical and mental health, so treat screen time like you would anything else that can affect you health. Monitor and examine how it effects you. List the benefits and negatives , and you will be able to discover what you can do to integrate screen use into your life while minimizing any health effects. And keep up to date with new studies and new technologies; you may learn things which cause you to re-evaluate your current usage. And above all else; don't rely on screentime activities to provide you with everything (work, entertainment, social interaction). Variety is always the healthiest choice.",25,6,14,0,5,11,5,6,0,5,0.0,0.56,0.2,0.551219512195122

""Was it all some sort of joke?!"" asked the Vice President.

THe President shook his head sadly. ""No, it was no joke."" He had just gotten off of the phone with the leader of the United Earth - it seemed that most of the nations of the world had joined the group - and learned the whole story. ""It was a desperate defense strategy.""
""Defense strategy?"" asked the Vice President.
 ""Against what?""

""Us. Or rather the US as it was back then. You're only 45 right? So you've only learned the cleaned up version  of our history and that war."" 
""Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?""


""Everything. The President back then was ruthless, self absorbed, and determined to put the US in control of the whole world. And our military was strong enough to do it. If it hadn't been for the other nations of the world uniting against us, we would have won. And even then, they were afraid of us recovering faster and trying again. So they came up with a plan to trick us into voluntarily isolating. There is a lot more, but that is the short version.""

""So what do we do now?"" asked the VP. 
""I don't know.,"" said the President. ""I just don't know.""

Fortunately the population of the US did know. They were not happy about being tricked into isolation, and they were not happy about the fact that the rest of the world had been working together for 50. But they had become very practical over the period of self isolation and they weren't going to give up, or do anything rash now. They were going to work together to get their country back on its feet and then they were going to start working on the rest of the world.

And so they did. With an emigration from the US to rival the immigration to the US of the old days. US citizens moved to every country that would have them. They brought their work ethic, their culture, and their determination. And slowly the regained the trust of the world. And eventually the US was invited to join the United Earth. 
The US accepted the invitation, and became a full member of the United Earth.
 And less than 50 years later, the first US territory citizen was elected President of the Earth.
And the rest, as they say, is history.

1096,23b5950573434bfeb67e045c39c17d50.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the amount of danger involved in a sport should have no bearing on whether that activity constitutes a sport or not. A sport is defined to be a physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. Nowhere in the definition of a sport does it say that the activity must be safe. I'm pretty sure if I were to look up this definition in the dictionary the dictionary would be silent on safety. And in fact, think about some of the most popular sports in America. Football, hockey, boxing and mixed martial arts are all extremely dangerous sports. I recently read that football players are three times more likely to die from a brain injury than the average person. And don't even get me started on the dangers involved in boxing and mixed martial arts. Did you know that in the past decade, there have been over 1,000 deaths in boxing? And further, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in mixed martial arts since the sport's inception in 1993? If we have those kinds of statistics for sports that are considered to be ""safe,"" what does that say about the dangers involved in other sports?

I just don't think that there is any way to make a sport that is inherently competitive and inherently involves a test of physical and mental strength totally safe from all risks. After all, think about some of the sports that you'd likely to be consider more mundane and safe. Let's take golf, for example. Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records. As a result, many of the athletes developed eating disorders and even had to seek psychological counseling.

So is extreme mountain climbing really that much more dangerous than the sports that we all know and love to be safe sports? I don't really think so. While it's true that extreme mountain climbing is dangerous, it's also true that there are plenty of other sports that are just as dangerous. On the surface, it might seem that extreme mountain climbing is more dangerous than other sports, but when you really look at the statistics, it's not that much different. And extreme mountain climbing deaths and injuries might be more publicized because of the nature of the sport, but that doesn't mean that it's any more dangerous than other sports. When was the last time you heard about a golfer dying from a heart attack or a runner dying from heat stroke? It's likely that those stories haven't made the headlines but that doesn't necessarily indicate that those sports are any safer than extreme mountain climbing.

So in conclusion, I think that it's silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is a dangerous sport. All sports are dangerous so it's sort of just a redundancy to have to expressly state that. And I think that it's also silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is not a sport. Does it involve physical activity? Does it involve a set of rules? Does it involve competition? I can check all of those boxes. So it certainly meets the criteria for a sport. I think we can all set aside the level of safety for the sake of argument here, because it's not really that relevant to the question of whether or not extreme mountain climbing is a sport.

In conclusion, I'm someone who enjoys a good debate. So I'm willing to listen to your arguments and to consider your point of view. But that doesn't mean that I'm going to change my mind. I'm very certain that extreme mountain climbing is a sport and I'm also very certain that it's not any more dangerous than other sports. But I welcome you to share your thoughts on the matter.",51,5,10,0,36,40,37,3,0,37,0.0,0.19607843137254902,0.7058823529411765,0.3712035995500562

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" 

You look around, and see a tiny bee, about the size of a thumb, with a tiny crown on its head. You look around, and see that the other bees are all similarly tiny, and all have crowns. You ask the bee what the purpose of their crowns are and the bee tells you that the crowd represents that they are royal bees and can make royal honey. 

You ask the bees what the difference between regular honey and royal is. The bee tells you that royal honey can be produced quicker and also adds strength to any animal or human that eats it. 

You ask the bee if it would be possible to make a batch of royal honey and the bee tells you that it would be possible, but that it would cost you big time. You ask how much it would cost and the bee tells you that it would cost a year of your life. You tell the bee that is way too big of a price to pay and go your separate way.

Later that month you see a man walking down the street and he has giant muscles. You stop him and ask him if he had any encounters with a bee wearing a crown. The man tells you that he did and the bee gave him royal honey for free.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, it is the schools responsibility to provide tampons and pads to female students that are in need and/or families that can't afford them. Taxes are being paid and if a school can provide toilet paper, they can provide tampons and pads. 

I obviously don't know the costs of these items when you're buying large amounts of them. Tampons, pads, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. I do know that schools make a ridiculous amount of money from our taxes. I do know that schools should be a safe space for children.

I know that it can be extremely embarrassing for children to talk about personal hygiene. I can only imagine what a female student would be feeling in vulnerable times. I am a man so luckily I have never had to deal with any issues like that pertaining to personal hygiene.

I understand that toilet paper and paper towels might be a bit different, but that is only because they're unisex. What is the difference between cleaning our butts and our private areas for example? 

I have no experience with anything period related because again, I am a man. However, I don't think it's hard to figure out that it can be very embarrassing for females, especially younger females who are experiencing these things for the first time. 

I would hope that most schools would at least have meetings about this topic. I'm not exactly sure if this is a women's rights issue but I do believe women should be making the decision pertaining this topic. After all, this is an issue that really only involves women so us men shouldn't really have an opinion on it. We don't know what women go through as we physically can't experience it. 

I hope at the very least this topic becomes more of a hot bed issue in schools. We want to make students as comfortable as humanly possible. And the best way that can be done is to simply listen to the students and act in their best interest.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

I believe it is ideal that citizens should be informed with current news to some extent. It gives more awareness on what's going on and enables us to make better judgements and more educated decisions regarding issues, events and other things that may impact us in a significant manner. In addition, having many citizens keep up with the news allows important issues to be noticed by the collective population, and allow many to join together as a group to voice our concerns and/or opinions regarding those issues, as is the case with most protests. However, I do not believe it is reasonable nor practical for many citizens to be informed about all events that are currently happening in the world. There is simply too much information out there, about every issue and event that may come into existence. In addition, the prevalence of misinformation and false news makes it quite difficult for people to engage with and learn more about certain topics. In that sense, it is not wrong for a person to be selective on what kind of news they follow or chose to engage with, as long as they can be flexible in their thinking, and be open for discussion when others wish to inform them of key events occurring in the world. 

As for our responsibility to engage with current events, I'd think it is paramount, at least to some extent. Without the majority of people engaging with current events, which includes spreading awareness of them, I believe many current issues and problems that exist in the world would go unnoticed, and effectively uncontested. It is absolutely crucial to engage and talk about topics and events occurring in the world so we, as a group, may come to a consensus and create an optimal solution towards the problems that affect the people of the world. Given the prevalence and widespread use of social media and modern forms of communication, I believe many people can spread the means to get people engaged with current events. I have seen this first hand, through major events that were first reported via social media, such as natural disasters or political events with people asking others for assistance in a multitude of ways. n terms of whether engaging with current events results in anything, I'll say that  has and will still be able to do so for future occurrences. Even if some that learn about the news chose to do nothing about it, there will always be others that take the initiative to do something about the issue. There will be citizens that take the extra step through protests, donations, volunteering, and much more when they engage with current news, beyond just learning about it. While citizens that don't keep up with current events aren't necessarily bad citizens, it is those that take further steps to change the world for the better along with keeping up with current events that makes them good citizens in my opinion.",21,6,9,0,6,8,6,2,1,5,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.2857142857142857,0.4444444444444444

The pig thought about this for a moment. He thought about the pigs who had gone before him, and how they had all built their houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks. About the futility of it all, and how they had spent their lives, building and building, and how it had all come to nothing. Sure, they'd prevented themselves from becoming a wolf's dinner, but in the process they had lost everything that made them who they were. They'd lived empty lives, bitter, and alone, and afraid. The pig decided that he'd rather be a wolf's dinner than live a life like that.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating much more easier.  It is far easier to find people that share your interests and that would be willing to date you.   have used dating apps and it has been a great experience.
  Before dating apps, I found it pretty hard to meet people that I connected with.  After college, I moved to a town where I didn't know anyone.  I didn't have friends who could introduce me to new people.  I didn't have a job that introduced me to a lot of new people in my age group.   

Dating apps allowed me to find people who were ready to date and were also interested in me.  I have never been the type of person to randomly walk up to a stranger in public to try to kindle a romantic relationship.  I worried about whether they were interested in me.  I worried about whether they were even single and looking to date.  With online dating apps, I never had to worry about that.  I could see that they were interested in me and that they were single.  It was a great way to meet people.

I think technology, overall, helps us to be more connected than in the past.  For me, I like having a way to communicate with my significant other even if we are far away.  I think this is a definite improvement on my romantic interactions.  It has helped my relationships to be stronger.  It has also helped me to be more open with my significant other.

In my opinion, there are advantages of listening to an audiobook. It does allow you to enjoy a book while you are doing other things. It allows you to enjoy a book without getting a headache from reading. You can use the time to sit in the bathtub and just listen. That can be very relaxing. It also allows you more time to hear the story especially when driving. Imagine going on a cross country trip and bringing audiobooks with you. You could easily get through multiple books even while driving. If you had brought regular books then you might have been lucky to get through one in your downtime. 
There are disadvantages to listening to an audiobook.
 You don't get that connection that you otherwise would have had from holding the physical book. Also out of sight out of mind comes into play as well. If you don't see a physical book sitting on your coffee table then it can be easy to forget that you were even reading in the first place. That's part of living a hectic life. 

It's gotten so easy to access audiobooks that they are just as available as physical books now. You can even download them for free via your library's app. No longer do you need to pay for an audiobook. That is a game changer. 

So which is the right choice, an audio book or a regular book? I think that depends on what your situation is and why you are reading. If you are busy and and otherwise wouldn't have time to read then an audiobook is a great choice. If you however have more free time then you can't beat a regular book. The most important thing though is to just keep taking in these stories that are available to us. The way they are delivered isn't as important as just doing it.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, No way, I do not think they are selfish. Probably just blind to the dangers they put themselves in. But if they know they are taking risks, then it is their choice. Even though yes they are putting others at risk of being emotionally hurt, but you have to ask yourself why do those that love people who do extreme sports love them in the first place. More than likely because they love the person for what they are, an adventurer, a go getter, a thrill seeker, and it takes serious courage and determination to do what these sportsmen/women do. That's why. The people that love them would not want them any other way. I think that if you love somebody, then you should support them in all their endeavors, dangerous or not.

Awhile ago I read a news article in the New York Times about mountain climbers in Canada that died while preforming their extreme sport, and the people who survived them did not think they were selfish at all. I have to agree with them. In my opinion people that do these kinds of sports are more than likely thrill seekers, but to me that is no different then a firefighter racing off to fight a fire and run into a burning building to save a life. Are fire fighters selfish for putting their lives at risk? I would say no definitely not, even though they might hurt their loved ones by not making it back alive. 

A lot of time people that go into extreme sports turn out to be great leaders, doing great things for their communities, like saving lives and such. They are not trying die, and they are not trying to hurt other people. It might be selfish to take your own life, but these people are not trying to take their own lives anyways. If they are willing to risk their own life for fun, they are willing to also risk it to save others as well. That makes them unselfish in my opinion.",22,5,12,0,5,6,6,0,0,6,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.22727272727272727,0.5

Of course, this was easy because all of the communications networks were destroyed during World War III.

 There are as many definitions are there are dads. In today's society, dad's are almost on an even keel with moms. They provide, nourish, educate, and spend time with their offspring. There are also many types of dad's including step dads, gay dads, single dads, and granddads. Their roles are quite essential in the raising of children. The better ones keep a sense of humor, spend time listening to their children, and model respect and kindness. 

Back to the mug rankings, in a society that swipes right or left, it is hard to pinpoint what makes someone the best or of a high ranking. The best parents are what their children need because that is how individualized relationships need to be. There are no two people or relationships that are the same. To girls, a dad needs to portray the behaviors that the girl deserves. She learns how to be treated by a man. To boys, a dad needs to portary the behaviors that he wants his girls to receive.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion,  technology can be a double edged sword when it comes to dating. It can reinforce certain things in dating that can be seen as a negative. For example, dating apps mainly use pictures to get the attention of people using them. Yes you can write a short biography but putting what you think will attract someone isn't always honest. So what else is there to judge someone by? Their pictures. I believe that more often than not, people with more pictures and high attractiveness tends to get more responses and attention on those apps. This can be a problem for people who are not as attractive or have pictures that aren't as flattering.  This can cause them to feel even more rejected than they normally would in the dating world.

Another thing it does is turn dating and match making into a numbers game. Instead of fewer, more genuine meetings, people are matching with large numbers of people and having multiple conversations at the same time. This can cause people to be more shallow and less genuine in their interactions. Or it can lead to people being less invested into  a conversation because they have more prospects lined up in their match queue to interact with. 

With that said, I do believe that technology can be a positive thing for dating. During the recent and ongoing pandemic apps and social media made it possible for people to continue to connect online. People suffered mentally and emotionally from not being able to socialize. Dating apps and such gave them a way to keep their interactions alive. It gave them a way to connect with people who were going through the same struggles. Not just that but it gives a chance to people who normally wouldn't meet. Just because their social circles don't run with one another. 

So like all technology, there are pros to cons to both. It all falls on people to use them for good over nefarious purposes.  Unfortunately, humans will always be flawed.",31,9,18,0,4,7,4,3,1,3,0.0,0.5806451612903226,0.12903225806451613,0.5123152709359606

The United States was forced to learn to live without the luxuries that it had become accustomed to.  The country also didn't communicate with anyone outside of the US.   

When the first Americans left isolation, they were shocked at the advancements of the other countries.  America's technology regressed while it was in isolation.  It ran out of the resources that it needed to make modern, at that time, technology.   On the other hand, the other countries' technology had by leaps and bounds.  

Every major country now had a well-developed space program.  This space program allowed these countries to harvest the resources in our solar system.  One of those resources is a resource called helium-3.  Helium-3 is a non-radioactive isotope that allowed countries to utilize nuclear energy without the fear of nuclear waste.   This meant that every person in these countries had access to plentiful energy.  They didn't have to worry about a home without heat or electricity.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, there is a specific stereotype that bugs me. It's the idea that all people who are overweight are lazy and eat junk food all day. Although society has gotten better and you see it less, there is still plenty of this type of stereotype portrayed in TV and film. Often times in movies you see that the person who is greedy or just plain lazy is portrayed by an overweight person. Most of the time, this is not true at all. In real life, plenty of people who are both lazy AND greedy are often beautiful and healthy looking. That message perpetuates a misleading image about something that is far from healthy. In addition to that the overweight person stereotype is usually given horrible lines to say and laughs at themselves and their predicament. It is common to see less character development over all with overweight stereotype characters. This gives a damaging view of things to society as though a person who is overweight isn't capable of change or is somehow less than human. 

Another reason this type of stereotype makes me cringe is simply because I'm a caring human being and I personally know people who have suffered emotionally because of being over weight. I know they often are harder on themselves because of this type of stereotype. Watching movies and film should be a way to escape and enjoy some downtime. Not feel like the world is laughing at you and you are some seen as immoral for who you are. In conclusion, overweight stereotype characters bother me the most, because they are hurtful to innocent people and they aren't even funny.

 They are an absolute necessity for health and function and if a student struggles to afford these items through no fault of their own, they would benefit immensely by having schools that provided them free of charge. Pads and tampons are vital in the same way that Band-Aids, toilet paper,  and other hygiene items are.

In my opinion, I think college athletes should be paid as long as other kinds of students get paid too.  Schools should make as many opportunities as possible for students to get paid. I think that if students are good at something, they should be paid for it. I think this is especially good in STEM fields because students who are good at STEM fields can make a lot of money. If they have good chances of making a lot of money professionally, why not let them get paid for their work now? If only college athletes are being offered a lot of money for their skill, this could lead to jealousy and resentment from other students. Fairness is important. 

One thing to consider is separating athletes into their own school. This would allow them to get paid for their work and not have to worry about other students getting jealous. This would also allow them to focus more on their sport and not have to worry about schoolwork. This could lead to a new generation of primed athletes and a new age of sportsmanship.

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is how to think critically. This is an essential life skill that is often overlooked during education. 
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think critically.
 I have learned how to think about a problem, come up with a solution, and then evaluate the solution. Critical thinking is a method that is taught specifically in higher education for certain professions, such as healthcare professionals. However, it is not taught in a general sense. I think that critical thinking should be taught in schools from a young age. Ideally this would be taught in a small classroom size setting, where the teacher can work with each student individually. This would allow the implementation of a more hands-on approach to learning in all subject areas. 
IAnother way to increase critical thinking in early childhood education is by homeschooling. Homeschooling allows the parent to tailor the curriculum to the child's needs. Also, the child participates in elements of everyday life at home with an adult , which allows them to learn how to think critically in a more natural setting. By shadowing adults as they work through everyday problems and problem solving, children are able to learn how to think critically in a more natural setting. This allows for a smoother transition into higher education and working age.  I promote and support any form of teaching that allows for more hands-on learning.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. 

Animals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. 

On some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. e can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation.
 We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. 

With human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first? Hmans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words.. Can't they defend themselves? 

This doubt, consequence, and human religion is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless animal.   Animal abuse is more frequently wrong, and therefore, more widely condemned. ",28,7,14,1,6,11,8,3,3,5,0.03571428571428571,0.5,0.25,0.5

They do not even need to use controls. They just use their minds and it effortlessly goes off into space.

He is brought to an alien planet. There, they put him in a large room with a TV monitor. The monitor itself is the size of a movie theater screen. They turn it on and he sees countless mini screens, each showing earth's reaction to him being taken. He sees people crying and angry. He sees people praying for his safe return.

He then looks around and sees other aliens watching as well in other parts of the room. He begins to think that he was taken just so they could watch what we do, almost like earth is one big reality show. 

He then sees a screen of his wife and children. That brings tears to his eyes. He knows he has to get out of here, but he knows earth will rescue him. He just has to be patient.

Over time he goes from watching the monitors to then watching the aliens more. He is fascinated by how obsessed they are with the earth reality program.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has a really great influence on dating and relationships, and in my own experience, I've found it to be a positive one. Though I have never used a dating app, I've been in a couple of relationships throughout my life and technology has helped me maintain long-distance relationships that wouldn't otherwise be possible to maintain without it. For example, in my first relationship, I was in college in New York City, and my boyfriend was in California. We had no way of staying physically or emotionally connected at all, except through technology. I really enjoyed Skyping because it allowed us to see each other's faces and talk to each other, which made the distance feel less like a barrier. Plus, we were able to have some physical contact through Skype, which was really nice and was a huge help in keeping the relationship going. I'm almost positive that one of us would have broken up with the other if we didn't have Skype, because the distance was so hard to deal with and there were plenty of other potential partners for both of us. 

I've also really enjoyed Netflix in the context of my relationships. There is a reason why people always ask if my boyfriend and I are going to Netflix and chill. What does that term mean? It means that we're going to watch Netflix together, and it's a euphemism for hooking up. Watching a favorite movie or show on Netflix is always a good segue into a hookup, because it's a way to get physically close to each other without having to make the first move. And it always leads to a romp in the sheets. I personally love to Netflix and chill because I always know the night will end in some kind of physical intimacy, and I'm always up for that.

The only drawback to technology is really social media, because it can be a real source of drama. I know someone named Soeurette who got so jealous of her fiance Matt's ex-girlfriend that she hacked into her Facebook and Instagram accounts and started posting some really mean things about her. It was really bad, and it caused a lot of drama between Soeurette and Matt. I'm not sure if they're still together, but I know that Soeurette is in a lot of trouble with the law.

So in conclusion, I think that technology is generally a good thing for dating and relationships, but it can be a bad thing if you're not careful. Just don't get sucked into petty drama through technology and instead use technology to enhance your relationship and make it stronger. That's what I do, and it's worked out pretty well for me.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible for their actions in school. They should also learn how to be a good person and how to be a good citizen. In this way, it is easier for them to be successful in their career in the future. 

Being independent is the most basic skill to survive in the society. If you are independent, you can do anything on your own. You can make your own decisions and you can solve problems by yourself. You can also take care of yourself and not rely on others. 
Being responsible for your actions is also very important.
 If you are responsible, you will not do anything that is bad for yourself or others because you will think twice before making a decision. You will also be careful about your actions because you know that you have to take responsibility for them. All these result will result in everyone being happy and safe.
Being a good person is also very important.
 If you are a good person, you will not do anything that is bad for yourself or others, nor will you do anything that will hurt the society. A good citizen will respect the rules and laws of the society and will help others.

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.  Personally, if I had to choose between saving an animal or a person from a burning building, then I am choosing the person every time.   I am not saying that I am not an animal lover, because I am.  I think humans should protect animals as much as possible.  However, I believe that human beings are higher on the totem pole of life--for me.  

I believe that people are very empathetic towards the suffering of animals due to the nature of animals.  They are often cute and give unconditional love.  I understand how people become attached to animals.   I just believe that people should be more empathetic towards the suffering of humans.  

I don't believe we are as empathetic to human suffering as we should be.  There is clearly room for improvement.  Maybe, if human beings improved on empathetic they are, then this world could be a better place.  We could prevent certain problems before they get out of control.  Far too often, we don't worry about problems until it affects us personally.  If we could show more empathy towards humans, we could limit the number of times situations like this happen.  
I believe that we should focus on both animal welfare and human welfare.
   I believe there is room for us to care about both populations. However, if I had to choose, I would definitely focus on human welfare over animal welfare.  ",24,7,14,0,3,5,3,2,0,3,0.0,0.5833333333333334,0.125,0.4776536312849162

In my opinion, technology is something that can help you find relationships and build stronger ones. I personally rely heavily on online dating sites while at the same time we’re also seeing a rise in “dating” apps with some great algorithms for helping you find a match. It just gets easier and more efficient. If you believe opposite attract you can put in the characteristics you desire in a partner and search that way or find someone who has a lot in common with you as most do. Using apps to find love has never been so easy and common place. It used to be a fringe thing, then the younger generations started to embrace it and the rest was history. Now I would now have it any other way. I am sure it also helps you to be who you are (if you're honest) because so much is known about you before the first in person date. Its also hard for me to describe how good it is to weed out the people who you know will not work. 
Dating apps and tech is the way to go. Its the best way to find the partner you are specifically looking for (within reason of course). It simply gives you a whole ocean at your finger tips instead of the small pond around your town.  ",20,9,9,0,2,7,3,4,1,2,0.0,0.45,0.1,0.5952380952380952

So what happens when someone gets that number 1 ranking ? They get to be the number 1 dad. At least for the day of fathers day at least. Not everyone could be the best dad in the world but everyone could get the #1 dad cup. I think my dad is the best dad in the world and he could get that number 1, best in the world title. I just don't think dads want to be that number 2 dad. That's the one that makes your kid go to you mom and say ""Hey look dad, you're number 2?"" or worse yet #4 Dad.

Its a funny thing to do but we have all seen that life is about bragging rights. So whats that #1 Dad mug doing for the company ? For one, they have a #1 Dad mug out there which is good for sales. The company must be selling a lot of those mugs because they have to come up with more and more of them as the Dads out there buy the mugs so they can call themselves the ""#1 Dad"". I don't think it sells as much as the ""World's Greatest Dad"" mug, but i'm sure it sells well. Actually any dad mugs are good sellers, if not the the season dads just buy it to boost their identity as a false sense of actually being a great dad. A mug does not make someone a great dad automatically , you actually have to be a great dad. But hey we will just call you the best dad in the world because of a mug. So if you are the best Dad out there, make sure you show off that #1 dad mug this fathers day. I know my dad would be proud to have a number 1 dad mug, so will you. :-) When that time of year comes people will no matter what buy those mugs and it will boost the companies sales , it is guaranteed that millions of these will sell each fathers day.

A few times it does feel like the news will depress me all day, because everything seems so broken now. It doesn't seem the same as the news my parents used to watch. There doesn't really seem to be any unbias news channels out there anymore. It's all political agendas, and most will try to manipulate you into agreeing with them, or call you stupid if you don't agree with them.

Let's face it, this country is so divided now that it is almost unbelievable. I feel like the news no longer paints us as Americans, but instead as democrats, republicans, or to cowardly to choose a side. I'm not sure how we can move forward until we can get people to stop hating each other, and remember that we are all from the same place. We are friends, neighbors, family, co-workers, and most of all Americans. It's ok to have different opinions, but it is not ok that the media makes us turn on each other. So I almost think that people who don't watch the news, are better people for it. ",22,6,12,0,4,4,4,0,3,1,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.18181818181818182,0.49577464788732395

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In this day in age, citizens all around the world are potentially subjected to a significantly higher amount of information, than citizens that existed in the past. For many in the past, it was not expected that one could know anything that was going on beyond their country or community, given the lack of technology such as the internet, social media, or even television and other types of viewing devices. Traditional media in those eras, such as newspapers were often locally controlled, and opinionated from a particular point of view that did not encompass all the perspectives and opinions prevalent in the world at the time. While people could be argued to be better informed of the local events that would affect them, today I believe people are much more informed of what is occurring all around the world. As a result of various factors, we might feel we have a greater responsibility to keep up all types of events, even ones that occur internationally alongside with local and national events. However, such a feat is difficult if not impossible for many citizens of the world.
One reason for a potential inability to deal with the amount of information out there, is a result of time scarcity.
 For most people have obligations to account for, in addition to taking the time to get informed and stay up to date with current news and events. Some have less time to keep up with the news, spending a lot of their waking time at work and other obligations. Others can have more free time to stay informed, which in too can lead to other actions such as political engagement and activism. The citizens with less time on their hands to keep up with the news are not necessarily worse than those that do, nor would I consider them bad citizens. In fact, I don't think it is possible for many to keep up with all current events, however I believe it is still their duty to at least stay informed regarding certain news and topics. 

A person that has a basic awareness of events that occur in the world can accomplish a lot more than they might believe. Even basic awareness can help by preventing events from being devastating, or circumstances being harmful. For this basic awareness people have coincides with the possibility they will spread what they know to others, and inform people of what events they are up to date with. With the prevalence of technology, this means people will know about the news more readily, especially with the impact of social media in connecting people with relevant information. This will lead to action, as there will be people who can do something about certain events, whether it is voting, protesting, and much more. It is vital that people stay informed about the news, but due to time constraints for most, they might not keep up with all the news all the time. Nevertheless, based on past experiences, even those with the most time constraints can have a positive impact on the world if they share take action themselves.",25,6,10,1,8,9,9,0,2,7,0.04,0.4,0.36,0.41056218057921634

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, all stereotypes are bad.  Even the ones that hold little girls are all sweetness and light are negative in that they deny little girls the right to be normal human beings.

I would not want to watch or read about all older people being fools, lacking technical skills and being a drain on public funds.  I suppose this is because I am one of those older people and none of that is true of me and pretty much every older person I know.  Ageism is a bad thing. 

All stereotypes encourage discrimination that people justify on the the basis of the stereotype.  It can actually encourage violence and persecution of groups of people.  Look at what happened all over Europe under Hitler and his like-minded allies.   

I think that the only way to combat stereotypes is to show that they are not true.  The best way to do that is figure out what stereotype fits the profile of the person spouting off and turn it against him and use it against him.  I guarantee it will fire him up and he'll be denying most if not all about what you are pronouncing as the truth about him.  It can be based on gender, age, looks, skin color, religion, political stance, size of his feet, hands, nose, head, his height, or lack thereof, educational level, income level, clubs, favorite food and drink, anything at all.  It's not hard to figure out one that will fit or even a combination that will. 

Hopefully, after that exercise the perpetrator will come to his senses and engage in some reflection that will will improve him as a human being.  No guarantee, but I'd say there is at least an even chance that it will.

Social media marketing has come a long way from its humble beginnings.
 It only makes sense that it would also change as the audiences that are being targeted, and the platforms on which they use social media, do. If your business is still operating under a strategy that's quite similar to social media marketing in the pre-2010 era, it's time for you to get out of the Prehistoric Age, and move into the future. 
Social media marketing has evolved from a simple presence on Facebook and other social networks to an incredibly valuable way to connect with customers, prospects, and
 communities in a real-time way. Mobile communication technologies enable us to remain connected to the people that matter the most, no matter where we are or what we’re doing. Companies can now keep their customers and prospects engaged throughout the entire lifecycle of their purchase journey, from initial awareness to purchase and beyond. Social media and mobile technologies can be used to increase sales, build brand recognition, and ultimately generate profit.

ocial media marketing is a great way for businesses to reach customers, build brand awareness, and create relationships.
 Social media marketing can be done for many different platforms and can range from very simple to complex. Many businesses, especially small businesses, use social media to promote their products and services. 
Social media have proven to be a valuable source of traffic for many websites.
 For instance, according to a HubSpot 2010 Survey, 72% of marketers use social media for content distribution. Furthermore, a 2012 survey by Social Media Examiner found that 94% of marketers worldwide use social media for business. In addition, a report by the same company found that 74% of marketers say that social media has helped them personally connect with customers.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this sounds like a very sound idea as long as the schools are able to afford it. I am not a female, however i know that when my fiancee gets her period it can be stressful when it comes to blood showing on her clothes if she doesnt have a tampon or pad. She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. 

I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for. I find tampons to also be just as necessary as the rest of the items. We all have to deal with blood at some point, so why not just deal with it conveniently? This convienance would mean more to the girls than i think they would even be able to communicate. Maybe not at first, but when it comes a point in time when they need it. Its like when you are trapped on the toilet with no toilet paper. Its like your stranded in a desert with no water or something. Well i could see this being the case as well for unexpected period blood. In conclusion, this is why i feel schools should provide free pads and tampons.",32,7,24,0,1,4,1,3,0,1,0.0,0.75,0.03125,0.4499054820415879

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people should want to keep up with what is going on. They don't need to know what is happening everywhere but it's good to at least know what is happening locally. I think it's important to know what is going on in your community and state. 

First it's important to know what may be going on for your and your families safety. You should know what is happening with the pandemic. You need to know if there are any upcoming severe weather threats. You should know what is happening with your local government and what they are doing to help the community. These are all things that can affect you directly. 

Second, you'll want to know what is going on so you don't miss out on anything fun. You don't want to miss out on a great concert or festival. There could be a new restaurant opening up that you would want to try. A fair could be coming to town. These aren't crucial things but they are fun things that help to improve your quality of life. 

Third, you should want to know what is going on because it helps you to be a better citizen. There's chances to maybe help out. You can volunteer at a local shelter or food bank. You could see that the community theater needs some volunteers. You could see that your local library needs some help. These are things that may interest you but you wouldn't know about them without watching the news. 

Not following the news doesn't make you a bad citizen. It just means that you don't want to know what is going on. More than anything it just hurts you personally. You don't want to feel left out when your friends tell you about something fun that you never heard of. So I think overall it's just the right choice to watch the news. It can't harm anything and can only improve your life. ",30,6,16,0,8,15,8,7,1,7,0.0,0.5333333333333333,0.26666666666666666,0.4156479217603912

---

In my opinion, keeping up with the news is part of being not just a good citizen but a citizen in itself. You can't make informed decisions without knowing what is happening in the world. The pandemic and the recent political divide has shown that more than ever. People who do not keep up with the news are prone to just believing whatever conspiracy theories or lies are going around. That is a danger to our society. It currently is putting people's lives at risks as people believe masks and vaccines don't work due to the fact that they just ignore the facts.
In my opinion, just being a citizen is a responsibility.
 You have to do your part to know what is right and wrong to do. You can only know that by being informed in general. You can't be informed if you don't know what is happening in the world. One good example is with the coronavirus. People were claiming it was a made up disease just to make Donald Trump look bad. They ignored the fact that this was hitting every country, not just our own. You rationally would know that the entire world would not all lie just to make one country look bad. However, many people either ignored or refused to believe the news of what was happening elsewhere.
I think engaging with current events is important.
 Even if it isn't something as important as politics or the pandemic, it's still your duty as a citizen. What if you had children and by not watching the news you missed hearing about a carnival in a neighboring town? Your family missed out on a chance to go do something fun and memorable. 

There's different levels of importance when it comes to news. You don't have to keep up with celebrity news to be a citizen. However, you need to keep up with what is happening in the world. If that feels overwhelming, you at least need to know what is happening in your very own country. That is the only way you can make informed decisions. Because otherwise you are just blindly making decisions that not only have the potential to harm yourself but also your neighbors, friends and even your very own family.

 Shy people can interact with people they would never normally speak to, and introverts can talk to more people than they would ever even consider meeting. ocial media sites like Twitter and Facebook connect us to friends, acquaintances and strangers with whom we otherwise would never speak.
 f I lived in a remote part of Alaska, I would benefit from technology to meet new people and get together with existing friendships.
 

Technology also helps a quick match of potential partners. For instance, if you are looking for an ideal marriage partner, online dating sites can help you find someone with complementary interests. Dating apps like Tinder and other technology help you screen potential mates and avoid the “sunk cost” of wasting your time on someone unsuitable. Tinder allows you to “try out” potential partners so when you finally meet, it’s not a complete surprise. On online dating sites, you also have the opportunity to use profile photos, multiple photos and a range of writing styles to help choose a mate. inder and other dating apps allow you to quickly evaluate a large number of potential partners in a short period of time.
 There is no guess work of wondering whether this person is for you.

As a conclusion, I think apps like Tinder, speed dating and social media like Twitter and Facebook improve dating and relationships.",21,9,3,0,9,13,12,1,4,8,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.42857142857142855,0.53125

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made dating and relationships easier. in general My experience with dating apps has been great. Thanks to Tinder and OkCupid, I have been able to meet and date some really cool people. In fact, I am currently dating someone I met on Tinder. I met her at a bar, but we connected on Tinder first. The first date went well and we have been seeing each other ever since. I think that we would have never met if it weren't for Tinder. I believe this relationship will last because we have a lot in common and we are both very similar.

When it comes to Netflix, I think the effect on dating and relationships is neutral, and trivial. Before Netflix, people would go out to the movies on dates, or rent a movie, or watch TV. Netflix is just another way to do that, the 21st century way.

Social Media has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, and has also made it easier to meet new people to date. I think its effects have also been generally positive. The only downsides are that it can be a distraction, and it can be used to spread negativity. Checking up on a partner's social media accounts can be a good way to see if they are being honest, but it can also turn into a way to spy on them. Again, though, before social media existed, paranoid people would still check up on their partners, and it caused the same problems in relationships then, that it does now. Social media is just a new way to do it.

Texting is a great way to stay in touch with people, and it is also a great way to flirt. Emojis are a great way to easily express flirtatious or emotional sentiments, and texting enables plenty of that. Texting is also quick, and convenient, and not only does it enable new relationships to blossom, it helps to maintain existing relationships and keep them strong and healthy.

In short, technology has been a great boon to dating and relationships. It has created many new ways to start new relationships, and it has also made it easier to maintain existing relationships. It has some downsides, but those downsides are not new, and they are not unique to technology. So, the new things it has introduced, have been more than worth it.",33,9,0,0,24,35,29,6,0,29,0.0,0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.44798301486199577

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" That's going to be too hard to blow down. So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew down every other house in the neighborhood, but he was unable to blow down the 92nd little pig's house. 

He decided to go online and do some research on techniques to blow down houses. He spent hours on Youtube watching wolves use different techniques. He eventually decided most of them were just click bait and didn't really work. Then he came across one that looked promising. It took a lot of inner focus, kind of like karate. So the wolf went to his dojo, took some deep breaths, and then attempted to blow down the house.

It didn't budge. He next decided to try going on Facebook and see if he could find any enemies of the 92nd little pig. He quickly realized that the 92nd little pig had made enemies of several of his brothers. They were more than happy to meet the wolf to try and help him. 

They met outside of the 92nd little pig's house. The pig leaned out of his window upon seeing them. 

""Really, guys?"" said the 92nd little pig. 

That just angered them. The pigs began trying to help blow it down. They weren't good at it naturally, but they tried. And after a while they needed to take a break. They decided they would try all doing it at the same time. They got into a circle, held hands and began blowing as hard as they could. It worked! The house came apart, sending the 92nd little pig running angrily outside. He then stopped, looking at the destruction.

""You guys have a good technique."" said the 92nd little pig. 

""Thanks, we worked well together."" said the wolf. 

""You know who we should use this on? That 94th little pig. He thinks he is so much better than us with that gold house. You guys in?""

Everyone nodded in complete agreement. So the group went on their way, joined in their hatred of a new common enemy.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, I think that we should at least have an idea of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be balanced in our news consumption, but not overly stress over events out of our control. 

I remember growing up in a small town in Idaho in the 80's and there was one news station. It was always just the same far-right conservative story over and over again. There were no other sources of information and the news station only talked about local events. This echo chamber made it harder for new ideas or viewpoints to be presented.  This rigid intractability made it harder for me and people from the region to grow, move on, and learn later in life. 

Even a small amount of empathy, and being exposed to differing views in news stories is beneficial. If you are exposed to world news, it makes it harder to have an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Realizing that we're all humans, with the same motivators, regardless of skin color, is eye-opening. 
As technology becaoe smore advanced and phones and laptops were invented, it bis asier to access the information from all around the world.
 In this day and age, it is pretty hard to be disconnected from the internet. With social media apps and news stories being shared all the time, it is hard to not be aware of certain things that are going on in the world. 

I'm not saying we need to spend each day looking at the internet for new and sensational stories.  Looking a couple times each week is fine, and you can also get local news from friends and family.  This helps build strong ties in local communities!

Finally, it's important to be conscious of the news that you pay attention to. The world is extremely complex and you can't be aware of everything. You should know how and why news is framed, who makes money off of it, and what is the truth behind each story.
Be cautious about what you consume, but make the effort. But don't worry about solving all of humanity's issues that you hear about on TV.  We all have to work together on those!

Head into the car and turn on the radio to the station 88.7 FM and await further instructions."" You look around your house for any signs of a break in, but you don't see anything. You scoff at the contents of the letter, believing it is no more than a prank phone call. Suddenly you receive a text, with the same message from an unknown sender, this time mentioning that you will be in great danger if you don't head to your car immediately. Humoring the text, you decide to head to your car and turn on the radio to the station 88.7 FM, as the letter had mentioned.

You hear static, and you wonder if it was all an elaborate joke. Suddenly, a voice comes on the radio. ""Mr. President, we need you to follow the next instructions exactly as we tell you. You need to go to the following address, and you need to go there now. The address is 545 E. Main St. at Smithsville, it will be an unmarked building, Go there right now."" 

Feeling as if this was less of a prank and more of a serious threat, you start the car, and turn on the GPS to get directions to the address mentioned by the voice on the radio. You arrive at the building, and you are surprised to see that it is an abandoned warehouse. There is no one else in the vicinity, and no other buildings in the distance. The door is unlocked, and you enter it to find yourself in a massive dimly lit room. You are greeted by a man in a suit, who tells you that he is glad that you were able to make it. He never discloses his name to you, preferring to keep his anonymity. He tells you that you are in a safe place, and that you will be able to leave when you are ready. He mentions that you are currently being target by extraterrestrial forces, who are currently planning on taking over the world by replacing the many leaders and political figures currently alive. He tells you that you are the only one who can stop them, and that you must do so by using your knowledge and experience as a former president. The organization that he works for is unsure who to trust, but assures you that they have not yet been infiltrated unlike potentially other agencies in the US. He tells you that you will be able to use the resources of the organization to help you in your quest to stop the extraterrestrial forces. 

He then awaits your response, in which you gladly agree. You realize the urgency of the mission, and how many lives are depending on your role.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, they should be provided in schools. I feel that for some reason there is a stigma surrounding them. I'm sure many people would say it'd be no different than just offering condoms in school, though they are entirely different things. That is the issue though, how people would react. Rather than it being thought of as something like toilet paper, it brings up a sense of anxiety in even talking about such things for many people. 
I feel that it would be a great thing for schools to do, but I don't think it should be required.
 When you start requiring something is when you bring too much attention to it. People get outraged and will fight it. Leaving it optional sadly will not help everyone since more conservative schools would not participate. However, it would still allow many young girls to have access who otherwise wouldn't have before. 

I believe that money could be put aside for it, though I'm not sure if it would have to be pulled from other areas or departments. It is important though so it needs to be done. Maybe changing the way people think about such would help. If we can educate people that it's no different than a band-aid then it could be available in any medical kit at school or nurses office. I think that would be the best way of going about this. 

In general I believe schools should carry free pads and tampons. For that to happen though, funding will not be the only issue. We need to change the perception of what such items really are and that they are medically related. That way people will more easily embrace the concept and it will over time just become the new normal in our school systems.",25,7,17,0,1,5,1,4,1,0,0.0,0.68,0.04,0.5286103542234333

He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf.

---

In my opinion, all citizens should keep up with the news to some extent, but not to the extent of being critical to the news. Knowing what is happening around you is important as you need to prepare for any type of emergency. However, being critical to the news is a bad trait because it will cause restlessness in the society. If everyone is critical of what the new says it will cause less happiness and peace. Therefore, we should know what is going on around us and not be critical of it. Thus,all people should keep up with the news to some extent, but they shouldn't get criticism towards it.
 Everyone should digest the news on their own and shouldn't force someone to accept their viewpoint. Being critical towards the news will only cause tension and even violence in the society. The world is already in a bad place, and we need to get along with each other if we ever want it to succeed again. 

To sum it up, we should know what is going on in the world by keeping up with the news, but we should not get critical of it just because we think differently from what is reported.

By just isolating the United States had somehow prevented its own demise. The other countries had some kind of issue that had escalated to the point of no return. Now it was up to the United States to try and get the world back up and running. 
The only problem was that the United States was in no shape to do so.
 We had struggled during that time from the lack of trading and having access to foreign technologies. We had to rebuild everything. We just weren't in the best situation to do so. 

We asked for volunteers who would go to different areas of the world to start helping rebuild and to help survivors. Many volunteered to go to what are considered nicer countries. Few volunteered for the already poverty stricken areas. 

Once people set up around the world, it started to rebuild. We were able to get the world back up and running, but it was a very slow process. There was one thing we didn't expect though. The very people who we sent over ended up siding with the local inhabitants. This ended up causing yet another world war. It went on and many of the already limited population died. It was then decided that we would all isolate yet again for another 50 years.

The world is now a place where war is legal once again, and the US is the only country that has not been involved in any conflict for 50 years. The United States has basically turned into Switzerland, a neutral country that won't get involved in conflicts they don't need to be involved in.

The United States economy is thriving because of this. GDP is high, unemployment is low and morale in general is sky high. The United States has become the envy of the world. They have an economy that is booming, phenomenal foreign policy and even universal healthcare.

Now you may be asking yourself why other countries can't become this neutral power. The answer is simple, other countries don't have the resources that the United States have. Some countries simply have to fight with others simply to survive. They need the medicine, the resources and the land that other countries inhabit. 

The United States also has another advantage over these other countries. The United States is known worldwide as the only true superpower left. No other country is going to want to get into a conflict where they are most likely going to lose. Other countries don't have the power, weapons or technology to overtake the United States. 

Now the United States could be a bully and try and take advantage of their advantageous position in the world.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. Her name is Lucy and she has a disorder called temporary amnesia where she totally forgets that she keeps on seeing the same guy. The guy's name is Jake and he's generally quite good at changing his identity up to keep Lucy off of his tracks. For example, sometimes he'll bump into Lucy at a coffee bar and he'll make some excuse for how he's really a coffee fiend. Other times he'll bump into Lucy at a bookstore and say he's really a lover of all books. And other times he bumps into her at a park and says he's really a nature lover. It really depends on where he bumps into Lucy. And he always makes up a new name and identity to go with his new hobby. But Lucy always forgets and falls for him all over again, even though Jake really doesn't change up his appearance at all. He's always the same guy.

Anyways, the issue with Jake is that he's a bit of a loser. He can't really hold a steady job. Whenever he takes Lucy out for a date, he always has to borrow money from his friend, Doug. And oftentimes, Jake doesn't even have enough money to pay Doug back. Sometimes, Jake has to borrow money from Doug just to pay Lucy back for the date. It's a little embarrassing to Lucy that her date cannot even pay for a Chipotle burrito bowl for himself, let alone for the two of them. In fact, Jake is so broke that he has to borrow money from Doug just to pay for the gas to drive to Lucy's house. It's a little ridiculous to Lucy but she keeps forgetting Jake's issues because she is so smitten that a man could have so many hobbies in common with her. 
Lucy and Jake's relationship is a bit of a mess.
 But one day, Jake has made up his mind that he's really going to make it work with Lucy. He puts on a suit and takes Lucy out for a nice dinner. At dinner, he orders a bottle of wine and he's really trying to impress Lucy. For his entree, he orders the lobster, which is the most expensive thing on the menu. When he asks what Lucy wants, she initially says she wants the chicken, but Jake tells her that he's going to order the lobster and that she should too. Lucy is concerned that she's going to be on the hook to pay for the dinner. But Jake tells her that he's going to pay for the dinner, and that she should order whatever she wants. Lucy whispers, ""Really?"" and Jake says, ""Yeah, I'm going to pay for it."" So Lucy orders the lobster, but she's still a bit concerned that Jake is going to have to borrow money from Doug to pay for the dinner. When the bill comes, Lucy holds her breath, because she's not sure if Jake has enough money to pay for the dinner. But Jake actually does come up with the cash. Lucy is so impressed that Jake is able to pay for the dinner that she decides to go home with him.

To be honest, he was beginning to be okay with the fact that he would die someday - it wasn't the bitter disappointment is was almost 60 years ago. 

But then the morning was ""as usual"" anymore. 
Dan was watching the news when the anchorwoman, a young woman who had been with the station for about a year, suddenly froze.
 She looked about 22, the age most people got the drug, though some got it as early as 16. She was frozen in place, her eyes wide and her mouth slightly open. Staring at the paper and then the teleprompter in front of her. She finally spoke, voice shaky, ""I'm sorry, we have breaking news."" Last month the earliest recipients of the drug 4EvR all reported to medical centers complaining of headaches. Within 6 hours they had lost their vision and hearing. Within 24 hours they seemed to be comatose, though brain scans showed the same activity levels as a normal, conscious person. They remain in that state.""

Dan stared at the screen in shock. The newscaster continued. ""Scientists have been studying their condition and have come to the conclusion that it is due to the drug 4EvR."" She began to cry, ""And according to their findings it is not only an inevitable side effect, but also one that is triggered or transmitted to users. To summarize, all people who have ever taken 4EvR will almost certainly have been exposed to others who have been exposed to the original group and we should all expect to experience the same side effects within 2 weeks at the most."" 
Dan turned off the TV.
 He was in shock. He had never taken the drug missing the age cut off by a mere two years, but all of his younger relatives had. His children, his grandchildren, so many others. Ans soon they would essentially be helpless with only a few aged people like himself to take care of them. 
Dan was suddenly filled with rage.
 It wasn't fair. He had had expectations, and now everything was upside down. This was not his problem to deal with. He sat at his desk, and shaking, wrote notes to all his loved ones. He wrote a note to his children, telling them how much he loved them, and how he was sorry that he couldn't be there to help them.

John is a man who is willing to do anything to protect his family, and he is willing to fight for his country, even if it means going to war. So John hatches a plan to fight back against the Soviets and the Chinese. He knows he needs to do so covertly, because if he is caught, he will be executed. 
John's plan is to form a resistance movement against the Soviets and the Chinese.
 He is able to recruit a few people to join him, including his son Jacob, his daughter Rachel, and a man named Tom. John's plan is to use his knowledge of the land to his advantage. He knows that the Soviets and the Chinese have no knowledge of the land, and he knows that he can use that to his advantage. He also knows that he needs to recruit more people to join his movement, and that he needs to do so quickly. So John and his group of freedom fighters set out to recruit more people to join their cause. 
John's plan works, and he is able to recruit more people to join his movement.
 He is able to recruit a man named Stuart, who is a former member of the U.S. military, and a man named Charlie, who is a former member of the U.S. Air Force. This is the perfect group of people since Stuart and Charlie have extensive vet experience. Now that John has assembled his team, he is able to begin his plan of action. 
John's plan is to attack the Chinese and the Soviets from the inside.
 He and his team will go into the Rocky Mountains and set up a base of operations there. From there, they will be able to launch attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. It's really the ideal setup, because the Soviets and the Chinese are completely unaware of the fact that there is a resistance movement against them.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J.

But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

In my opinion, I would have to agree with the above premise.  I think it would cause a select few of these ultra athletes to be hunted an payed top dollar for. This could go wrong for a number of reasons. Young adults should not have high amounts of wealth and status because it will demotivate them in the future to pursue more in their sport or educational field. This could also be a problem because it would cause a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the other players. The top players would be praised with promotions and sky high contracts while the rest of the football players are depending on scholarships and their grades to keep them playing and in school. I think it would also give a huge edge to the universities that have the most money to spend on players, giving them more victories, more praise and eventually more money to buy better player. The cycle goes on. So in conclusion, no, college players should not be paid for their time for numerous reasons, almost all being negative.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

I can easily say that I cringe notably when I see stereotypical characters in any form of media that effectively portrays people and certain demographics in a negative and offensive way. I cringe from these types of characters because I not only find them lazily written and one-dimensional, but that they are a negative addition to any show, book, or movie, that has consequences to its viewers. Not only do such characters illicit negative responses from other people who find them offensive, but they also perpetuate negative ideas and responses about these character groups in the real world. Many people hold stereotypes towards racial groups, as well as other types of minorities. Stereotypical characters reinforce those stereotypes and thus become a way to perpetuate and even justify negative and stigmatized attitudes towards those character groups. This can lead to said groups being viewed as lesser, even potentially dehumanized. I cannot say that I am willing to accept those characters in any media or content that I consume, given that their presence or implementation are not necessary, or a meaningful addition by the writers or creators of said content. 

For some pieces of media, if the portrayal of a stereotypical character is too offensive or disingenuous and a critically seen part of the content, then I will either avoid that show, book or movie. Seeing such characters are not pleasant for me personally, which is also true of other people, and I don't enjoy engaging with shows that overall make me feel uncomfortable or negative in some way. While there are shows that can make me feel sad or even uncomfortable with what it depicts, in those instances those are intended in either a more thought-provoking way, or respectful manner. I am not referring to those types of cases, and instead refer to how stereotypical characters can feel insulting and unrealistic in the context of a show, movie, and book. They are rarely thought-provoking or meaningful in the context of such media, and could be rewritten to be much more respectful, or even more relevant to struggles of the group. 

Often times, it feels as if creators don't take the time to script stories relatively authentic script about characters or groups, but instead prefer to rely on stereotypes which are easier to implement, and take significantly less time. If I feel that I am not being valued or respected as a viewer watching the show or reading a book, I would prefer to read or view something else. I know there are much more respectful ways for creators to portray characters in their shows, movies, books, etc. than the ones that portray them as no more than stereotypes, and those are a better use of my time. As viewers, writers, consumers, and individuals with other identities who are not well seen in media, we have an obligation to demand better representation, and for others to create as such to reduce stereotypes in society, not reinforce and perpetuate them.",20,4,8,1,7,8,8,0,3,5,0.05,0.4,0.4,0.43097014925373134

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is music. Music is a great way to express yourself and it can be very fun. It builds strong team skills, and is also great at teaching one how to work well alone. It is also a great way to express your feelings, and can help you get through tough times. If music is introduced early on in school, it can help students to be more open and creative. Each student should be matched to their ideal instrument. This will help them to be more successful in the future. There should be time set aside for music every day, and it should be mandatory. Studies have shown that music helps to improve memory, and can help students to be more successful in school. It helps improve focus and attention span. It also helps to improve self-esteem and confidence. Students that don't study music in school are at a disadvantage. They are more likely to have lower grades, and are more likely to drop out of school. Students that don't appreciate music should go to a separate school. That way, focus can be placed on music, and students can get the most out of it.  Music studies can include music history , theory, and performance. The families can be included in the music studies, and can help to learn the instruments. They can participate on performance days. The students can also learn to play instruments that they are not required to play in school. There should be nothing holding the students back from learning music.",26,6,6,1,13,26,15,11,0,15,0.038461538461538464,0.23076923076923078,0.5384615384615384,0.4458204334365325

I don't remember how I got here, in this dimly lit, heavenly cinema with all of these people.  I try hard to remember what happened previously by asking the people in the cinema where we are. The person in front of me turns around and says ""be quiet, the show is about to start"".  To my surprise, the person in front of me looks similar to me, but with a subtle difference in facial structure. I turn around to the people behind me, but they all seem to look like my past reincarnations. I soon realize and remember, that I died in a tragic car accident at the age of 36. I was driving home after my birthday party, and a drunken driver crashed into my car. Even though I was wearing my seatbelt, I did not survive such an impact. uddenly, I begin watching a movie on the big screen in front of me.
 The man in the movie is a reincarnation of myself, but with subtle differences. I soon realize that this movie is about to start my new life. It feels odd to watch yourself live a life from the outside. he life on the big screen in front of me is similar to my previous life, but with subtle differences.
 In this life, I work at a big hospital, as a well respected surgeon, quite the difference from being a lawyer previously. This person is getting ready to perform a surgery on a small child. I remember that I used to take my children to a petting zoo when they were small. I always loved looking at them experience new things. It makes me wonder how my children and wife are doing, knowing that I have died. I understand that it is no longer about my past life, but about my reincarnated self. I am no longer worried about my loved ones, because I know that they will be fine. I feel a little bit at peace with myself, knowing that they will be taken care of. I continue to watch the movie in front of me, hoping that my reincarnated self with have a great life. hen I was watching this movie, I noticed that the life of my reincarnated self seemed to be an improvement from my past life.
 This self was more extroverted and daring, which was the complete opposite of myself. This person was living a life that I would have wanted to live, and it seems as though everything is going well. He seems to have a lot going for him, a great family, kids, the works. I am no longer upset about my death, because I know that my reincarnated self is living a much better life. I decided to stand up from my seat and walk out of the cinema, to see what waited for me on the outside. I walk outside, and I am shocked to see that the cinema which I was previously in was no longer there. In front of me was a beautiful city filled with skyscrapers and people going on with their daily routines. The architecture was built out of beautiful, golden, steel, brick and marble. The streets were clean and people were smiling and waving at me. Soon after, a man approached me, who went by the name Peter. I quickly understood that this man was Saint Peter, the gatekeeper. He offered to take me on a tour and to meet the person in charge. We walked for what seemed to be an hour in the wonderful city. Finally, we reached a set of giant, golden doors. I immediately knew that this was where the creator of our world resided. I was never much for the belief in an almighty being, but I guess I was wrong. The doors open and Peter points me in the direction of the creator. I walk up to the creator and I am both in awe and surprised. The creator is a woman, not a man as we were taught on Earth. She tells me that I lived a good life, with people who loved and respected me. It made me feel better about the whole situation. She continues to tell me that I can choose to continue my life, or I can choose to go back and restart my life again. It was a tempting offer, to go back to Earth and live with my loving family, but I know that it was the wrong decision. I enjoyed my life for what it was and now it was someone else's turn to live their life in my body. I tell the creator that I would like to continue my life, because I felt as though I could make a difference in this world. She smiles and sends me on my way back to the city. Peter then takes me to my residence and gives me a job. I know that I have chosen the right life, and it will be a pleasure to live it. I know that I can make a difference here and help people. Instead of being a lawyer, I have been chosen to be a doctor, like my reincarnated self. It is nerve wracking and exciting at the same time. I never had a problem with blood and I was always interested in medicine. Maybe it was why my reincarnated self became a doctor and not a boring lawyer. I am happy that I get a second chance to do something exciting and more fulfilling in this new life. I know that one day I will be with my family again, and we will be happy here.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we need to step away from the screens some, in social instances, while continuing to embrace them at work. I think IF someone can fill some of time spent in either class or work meaningfully, then they should use screens for this. With the pandemic NOT having totally ended we should mitigate contact with others WITH utilizing screens. WE should still embrace them.
I think we should be careful about the amount of time spent on screens, and I think we should be careful about the content that we consume
 though. While needed for work, using it to substitute fully for all life is bad. We DO need meaningful face to face with loved ones, particularly if they are vaccinated and masked absolutely embrace, love, and see others. Substituting virtual beings and data for life can have quite negative effects, particularly for young and forming minds, for those who are often marginalized and shunned anyway, and for those who have difficulty being alone. We must engage, socially, going out of our way to include, safely, others in real life. It's important to do so. 

It's a sort of delicate balance, involving people while utilizing remote work and schooling can turn out well. It's a balance that I think we should strive for. We need to improve our overall lives BUT we need to utilize screens sometime to do that. If we can minimize long horrid commutes via screens then, we should do this. We should also use that wasted commute time, now saved, to hang out with those we love, spend extra time with children/parents/friends.  Make NEW connections in real life using that time and saved resources. Take advantage, similarly of being able to get educated and improve your job skills via computers. Take up a hobby, involving others if possible. The world can be better and wider doing BOTH work with screens and expanding our social real world.  Lets live life more fully.

Wisely using screens for needed activities but eliminating them from unneeded ones. Shunning social media for news or time fillers and instead opting for real time meetings with friends, go out for coffee or better yet, a walk outside, with close friends. Put the screens away when we aren't at work or school. Open up the world. 
We can do it.
 We can learn, become more, become better. Screens can help if we use them wisely as the tools they are. Avoid using them as crutches though. We can be better and screens can be a part of that improvement.",34,6,25,0,3,6,3,3,0,3,0.0,0.7352941176470589,0.08823529411764706,0.49015748031496065

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

""You've eaten a lot of my kind, Mr. Wolf,"" said the pig. ""I won't be your next meal."" 

The wolf tried to get near the 92nd little pig to eat it but a force field of depleted uranium repelled him. ""Wha... what is this?"" asked the wolf. ""It's depleted uranium, you big bad wolf!"" Said the pig. The wolf tried punching the barrier but to no avail. It was shiny as new and the wolf eventually got tired of punching the barrier.

Then the pig said, ""I'm going to go get some more depleted uranium to make my house even stronger."" The wolf started laughing menacingly and said, ""Oh, I may not be able to eat you, but I can still eat your brother and sister pigs.""

Undeterred, the pig replied, ""We're not afraid of you anymore, wolf!"" We outnumber you! They've also built their own houses made out of depleted uranium!""

The wolf was dismayed. He looked on the distant fields and sure enough, the other houses were also built using the same material.

The world has changed drastically in the last 50 years, and the real question remains: Why?
 I think the advancement of technology has played a major role in that. Technology has changed the way we get information, the way we communicate and overall how we live our daily lives. 
SThink about children for example. Back in the day, children would have to go out and play with their friends in order to have fun. Now children are glued to their phones playing games and apps and not getting the in person socialization that us parents got as kids. 

I think the advancement of technology has also caused many to be more connected with one another, but in a different way. My father has family in Italy. He is able to communicate them because of these technological advancements. He can use Face Time so he can see his family rather than just a phone call where he can only hear them. 

I think another reason why the world has changed is simply because over the last 50 years tons of mistakes have happened and we have learned from them. Like for example, after World War I and II we have worked so hard to make sure that the same mistakes are not made again. Diplomacy and negotiation is much more valuable than the bloodshed and consequences from something as serious as a World War. 
I personally think that technology has truly changed our world in a positive manner and I can't imagine what life would be like without all of
 these devices at our fingertips. Of course there are some negative aspects of technology as well, but overall it has bettered out world. 

Think about all of the information that we have at our fingertips. Think about GPS. Think about Face Time. Messaging apps. Yelp. DuoLingo. Think about all of these things that we use on a daily basis.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.  
I believe that parents should supply students with period products.
 Parents don't want schools to teach their children about morality and controversial reproductive issues, therefore, they need to provide the products they want for their children.  Tampons are like deodorant. If you teach your kid that the aluminum in deodorant is causing health issues,  you should provide the product that you want your kids to use, yourself. 

eriod products are not expensive for women and it is a personal issue.
   As a product some people may also be sensitive to it. Some people may need custom products because of allergies. Once schools open the door to being the provider of these products, they also become responsible for custom items. 

Parents are the ultimate guardians of their children, and should be teaching their children about the fundamentals of their reproductive cycle.   Schools should not have to be held responsible for a product that is so sensitive. I believe this is an issue solely for parents and their children.  Schools should focus on learning, with perhaps a small supply of products for emergencies only. ",24,7,9,0,8,14,9,5,1,8,0.0,0.375,0.3333333333333333,0.4788273615635179

The aides reported back to the president with their report. Their reactivated satellites that were dormant for 50 years revealed no movement nor any other human activity visible in the other parts of the world.

""They just left, Ms. President,"" said one of the aides. ""We've tracked a spaceship heading towards Mars. The last people on earth left 10 hours ago.""

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 
It all started with the discovery of an old European text from the dark ages. It had instructions on how to find these Mana that will once again allow humanity to once again wield powerful, magical powers. It could not have come at a better time since 99% of the population had been destroyed by this evil alien race. The leader of the new human resistance and his team find 13 different Mana stones that contain concentrated magical powers. He then used the book to recite the words that would release the magic from the stones. It worked. The magic slowly left the stones and flowed into each human being in the room. Instantly, the whole team had different magical powers that they could use at any time. But now they had to find more mana stones and unlock their magic powers before the evil aliens found out. It was crucial that they find more so the rest of humanity can have magical abilities. 
The team used a map on the back of the book that led them to Merlin's old lair. When they got there they found hundreds of Mana stored behind a hidden wall. This should be enough the leader says. So they collected all the Mana and went back to the only surviving, human city. The mana was distributed across the population where the magical mist left the stones and entered the crowd. Everyone now had different magical powers. They then used them to turn the tide of war against the occupying alien force and defeated it. The aliens left and the human race rebuilt bigger and stronger then before. ",21,3,16,0,2,3,2,1,0,2,0.0,0.7619047619047619,0.09523809523809523,0.5279503105590062

Although over time due to limited food they would pass away from starvation, in the end there remained 20 little pigs that survived. When they were old enough, the mother pig sent them away to find new homes for themselves, and hopefully start a family. They would try to survive in a harsh world with the homes they would build, out of any materials that they could find. Many found that there homes could not withstand the forces of nature or the attacks of predators, and died soon after. Only one would survive to live to adulthood, the last and youngest of the 20 little pigs.

For you see, the 20th little pig built a house in a distant and hidden part of a forest, made up of bricks and mortar, and it was strong enough to withstand the forces of nature. However, unlike his siblings who had also built houses sturdy enough to stand against harsh winds and natural disasters, the 20th little pig had devised a way to avoid predators. He had built a massive underground bunker, with a maze of tunnels that he could use to escape from any predator should they try to break into his house. The bunker was well hidden, fortified, and stocked, able to sustain him if the predators were to break into his above home. He would often leave his house unlocked at night, while he slept underground in his bunker, to fool predators into thinking the home was already abandoned. Sure enough, predators eventually gave up on the house of the 20th little pig. 

The 20th little pig was able to live a long life free from the threat of predators, and when he died he left his home to his children. They would keep his legacy alive, and continue to live in the house, and the bunker, that he had built. For unlike his siblings, he would still be alive like his descendants, who expanded his underground bunker. They would form a community of pigs, who would call themselves, ""The Bunker Pigs"", living primarily underground where no predators could catch them.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.
This is the story of how you, and the other Lost Generations, survive. in a world where everyone younger than you never ages, but everyone older than you avoided the side effects.

You, personally, were lauded throughout your life for discovering the drug that stopped the effects of aging in a younger population, but the government decided, in principle, to deny you the chance to benefit from it.  
You were offered the drug,bfrom the black market ut you refused.
  You, and many others like you, were outraged at the government's decision, but some of the others took the drug anyway.  

For the most part, you just live your life as normal in this new, boring world where young celebrities never age, and never get replaced by younger counterparts.  

Eventually, the outrage about the unfair distribution of the drug dies down as well, and the older generations accept their fate.  

If anything, the economy thrives, because people no longer lose their vitality as they get older, and they have decades of wisdom and experience to apply to new projects.  

You and some of your generation are still nostalgic for the past, but you accept that a world without aging, even if just for a few, is better than the world that we had before.  Even though you won't be around to enjoy it forever, you are glad that many others will be.

When you are halfway into your happy retirement, however, the side effects become clear.

This whole time you thought that everyone had stopped aging, but it turns out that they spent the decades aging very slowly.  The rate at which they aged was itself slowing down, and only recently had they reached the point where they truly did stop aging.  
You and the rest of the Lost Generations are now the only ones who are aging normally., and the younger people who took the drug still appear to be young and healthy.  However, in recent years, it has become clear that they are actually now aging in reverse.  They are moving backwards through their growth cycles very slowly, but the age at which they are going back is increasing steadily over time.  

If this trend continues the same way as it did when the drug was preventing aging, then eventually, they will all become babies again!  

The only hope for humanity is that these ""young"" people start to quickly have as many children as they can.  They all just have to hope that their children will age normally, just like the unlucky lost generation who never got to take the drug.  

The only source of comfort that you have in your old age is that you won't be around long enough to see the terrible impact that this side effect has on the world as a whole.

You are also glad that enough time has passed that people don't remember who you are.  If you thought they were mad when they couldn't get the drug, you can't imagine how mad the people will be when they learn what your miracle drug really accomplished.

When I wake up every morning, my daily ritual is to watch the 6 o'clock news.  When I turned on the news, the first story detailed a weird phenomenon that seemed to be happening around the world.  Dads around the world were watching their #1 Dad mugs change to different, seemingly random numbers right in front of their eyes.        

The news anchor was doing the story from a studio in New York and as soon as he started talking about the phenomenon, the mug on his desk changed to ""#500,000,000 Dad"".  He looked down at his mug and was startled a bit.  However, he was a professional and continued to do the segment.   The news organization had interviewed a woman who said he was responsible for the changing mugs.

She used a powerful spell that would reveal how good the dad's around the world actually were.   ust as the woman was about to explain the spell, she was interrupted by a mug that changed in her hand.
  She looked at the mug with disdain.  She said this was her father's mug.  She didn't show the number, but she seemed to agree with her father's ranking.

I have always thought I was a good dad.  My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and we have three beautiful children.  I was desperately curious to see what ranking my mug gave me.   I quietly walked to the kitchen.  Since I am the first one up every morning, I was alone while I was in the kitchen.  I started to open up the cabinet where I keep my mug.  Then, I paused.  What if I'm ranked ""1,000,000,001 Dad?"".  What if my ranking is absurdly low?  Is it worth it to torment myself.

After spending several minutes in thought, I had made a decision.  I closed my eyes and opened the cabinet.  I grabbed my mug and covered it with my hand.  I proceeded to dump it in the trash.   I had come to the conclusion that it would torment me if I looked at the mug.  I know that I try my hardest every day as a father.    I don't need a mug to tell me where I rank.

I quietly walked back to my bed where my wife was sleeping.  I knew that I was loved and that is all that mattered.  ",32,1,27,1,3,9,4,5,1,3,0.03125,0.84375,0.125,0.46335697399527187

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology actually helps with dating these days. It's a lot easier to meet people and get to know them before you actually meet them. I know I am very busy with work and don't have the kind of schedule that lends itself to meeting people in bars and such. Dating apps make it possible for me to meet other people that want to meet people without all the awkward fuss of going to a smelly bar.  also think that technology has made it easier to keep in touch with people and maintain relationships.
 In some relationships it's sometimes necessary to keep in touch with people via text or social media because they are not in the same city or even country. My partner had to travel for 3 weeks one time and being in contact through technology made it much easier. Another reason I think technology is good for dating is because it's easier to get to know people before you meet them. This means you can chat through the technology and find out enough about them before risking a miserable mismatched first date. If you don't hit it off right away, no hard feelings, AND you don't have to be all weird with them in person. The last reason I think tech and dating apps are good for dating and relationships is because it's easier to find people who are looking for the same thing you are. I just feel like when meeting people out in public it's really hard to know who is actually looking for something with substance.  With a dating app, you can learn what the person is looking for in a date instead of having to try and read their mind. There really are lots of benefits of technology when it comes to dating and that is why I think it improves romance.",22,9,8,0,5,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.22727272727272727,0.46736292428198434

1194,fa70668f568445dbbce5ec1e3ac03bd9.jsonl,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In general, people are more empathetic towards the suffering of animals, because they view animals as innocent and helpless. For most instances, animals cannot do something to prevent or even ease the issues that causes them to suffer. For that I believe many are more empathetic towards animals, than they would be for a person that is suffering as well. Say for instance, poverty and sickness, many would make the assumption that people that suffer from either could do something about their situation, such as getting medical help or acquiring a job/financial assistance. Therefore, it is not unusual that many who be more quick to aid an animal over a person, as they ultimately view people as much more capable of handling their own problems.
However, I do not believe that it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.
 I believe that it is important to help both humans and animals, as they are both living creatures that feel pain and have conscious thoughts. Although animals may not be able to vocalize or ask for help, they nevertheless have the desire to live free from harm and the threats of death, just like people do. In any case, a person that focuses on one cause over the other is not necessarily uncaring towards the other cause. It is can very much be that they have chosen to focus on one cause over the other at a given point in their life, and they may help more humanitarian or animal welfare causes in the future. 

It can be daunting for many to volunteer their time and donate money and resources for a variety of causes. Some may feel that their money might be wasted, or the particular charity they donated would be inefficient in utilizing their donations. For that reason, I think many chose to focus on one cause, such as animal welfare to reduce the time and effort on their behalf on researching whether their time and efforts are being adequately utilized to further the cause. In those instances, they are likely to make a greater impact on the cause they chose to focus on, than if they were to spread out their focus on several causes at once. As long as they take the time to better the welfare of either animals or humans, I think that is more impactful than if they were to not take the time to help at all. For many will invest their time, money, and resources towards the betterment of animals and humans. For that, I don't consider them unethical for focusing on one over the other, as they still are trying to resolve issues that affects many in the world, that requires immediate attention from those that can help.",23,7,12,0,4,10,4,6,3,1,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.17391304347826086,0.40421792618629176

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the stereotypical character of a woman staying at home to take care of the family and home makes me cringe. This is so outdated and portrays women as not being able to do anything outside of the house. Maybe this is how things used to be, but that's not the case anymore. It is not common to see a show with the man staying at home, so whey do they always have a woman taking care of everyone. 

I think this puts the idea in little girls heads that they should stay home and be a mommy and take care of everyone. I think we need to encourage young girls to follow their dreams and get a good education. There should not be this stigma where women can't do anything except care for the home. We need to showcase women doing whatever they set their hearts to do. There are many incredible women scientists, doctors, lawyers, business women. Women are smart and capable and I think that is what should be showcased. I definitely would not watch or read something that reduces the status of women. 

In this day and age this stereotype should be gone as I don't think there are many ""stay at home moms anymore"". It is much more common to have both parents working these days. This should be the new normal. Women in this day and age have so much potential, and I think that is what should be shown. When I think of women staying home and taking care of a family I picture my grandmother, who is long gone, ironing and cooking everyday. This is not something we see now, so why do they still portray it on television shows? I think this is a stereotype that could cause some damage if it is not removed soon, especially if these shows are watched by young and impressionable girls.

If I had young children I certainly would not want them watching shows that give off the impression that women should stay home and care for the family. I would want my children, both boys and girls, to realize that women can do whatever men can do, and they can do it just as well. I want them to know women are capable and I do not want the stereotype put in their heads that women are not meant to work outside the home. We need to show young kids that women can do whatever they want, and that they can be whatever the equivalent of a man is. It is definitely time to get rid of the stereotype that women belong inside the home.

I was 28 when English scientists discovered a miracle drug that stopped humanity from aging. Humanity had finally discovered the key to living forever, and avoiding the one debt that every human being owes upon birth, death. Scientists had warned that the drug was only meant for citizens under 26, which left billions of people, including myself, without any hope of taking the drug. People around the world were furious and saddened to hear the news that they would not live forever. Meanwhile, the younger generations were divided on whether or not they wanted to live forever. Taking the drug meant living forever or outliving loved ones and watching them pass on. The rest of the world was not as hesitant to take the drug, and many saw immortality as a chance for humanity to expand and achieve incredible things. Taking the drug would allow people to study whatever they wanted and help to improve society for the better.

Doctors no longer had to worry about sicknesses and disease among a large portion of society, they could now devote their time towards helping people who could not take the drug. The ""Lost Generation"" continued to age, while the young took the drug and became immortal. Families were torn apart, knowing that they would leave loved ones behind. They feared that their loved ones would forget about them as the centuries carried on. While the young celebrated their immortality, the old feared that they would be forgotten. As time passed, I grew older, finally reaching the ripe, old age of 85. Society had definitely improved through the efforts of an immortal, optimistic generation of people, with all the time in the world on their shoulders. They had set their sights on new frontiers that would be impossible for a normal human lifetime. Technology had improved by leaps and bounds, providing comfort beyond imagination for people from all walks of life. Medicinal advances provided the ""Lost Generation"" with cures for ailments that only affected an aging body. I began to wonder if taking the drug was worth it. At a certain point in time, the ""Lost Generation"" would be no more, ceasing to exist, leaving the immortals behind. Was living forever worth it? Were all of the human advances worth it in the end? The immortals were only prolonging the inevitable. I was concerned with how the immortals would feel after living for hundreds of years, or even thousands. Finally, in a shocking turn of events, scientists discovered that the drug resulted in tragic side effects.

No longer could they enjoy what made life so pleasurable, the biological features that made life worth living. The drug had robbed them of all senses, leaving them to a life where they were no longer human. They could not rely on the ""Lost Generation"", for they too needed help. One generation was dying naturally, the other were becoming walking husks, devoid of humanity. The immortals were now a burden, and the ""Lost Generation"" was stuck in between. The immortals were now at the mercy of the ""Lost Generation"", for they needed help. The ""Lost Generation"" could not help, they could only provide wisdom to ease the pain of living without their senses. The immortals were not the picture of humanity, they were a nightmare.

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, there are many pros and cons to paying college athletes. I personally feel that it is less problematic to not pay college athletes and for this reason i would side with not paying them. However, i think the root of the problem just comes with the large amount of money schools make off of these college athletes. NCAA is one of the highest payed organizations in the world, and much of this is because they dont have to pay their athletes. This makes people refer to the athletes almost like they are being taken advantage of. I understand the perspective of the athlete being taken advantage of, however they are still given the platform to demonstrate their skills, and also given the opportunity to play in front of large crowds and meet tons of people, and build a following on social media. Many perks come with being a college athlete aside from just possibly being paid. The free tuition is nice for the athlete, however i dont know how much paying the athletes would be helpful. Would they be paid based off of talent, or just a flat fee? If it was a flat fee, the athletes would probably want more anyway if they were the star players. I am personally a former college football player as well, and I just feel that it is not necessary to pay the players. I think it would be nice to have more in place for the athletes, but not necessarily just a pay check. I know there are some athletes who can barely afford college and food while being there. This is unexceptable to me if they are part of a team making that much money for the university. I would treat it like a job and simply provide the best working conditions for athletes that do a lot to help the school run. No student athlete at all should have to worry about getting food to eat, or having a place to stay. I think this is a good compromise to the problem. Using some of the money to give back to athletes instead of giving athletes the freedom to spend on whatever they wish. 

I am for the side of not paying athletes because i think there are too many variables associated with the amount you would pay them, and it is also sort of starting a bidding process right out of high school. College would almost be like the pros in a way if you could get paid like a professional athlete. If anything i think a flat fee would be most fair for everyone who was a part of the actual team. This way, nobody is glorified in the amount that they are paid. This would literally create powerhouses and the same schools would win every year just because they have the most money. I think it would be a good idea to have a stipend for the athletes as well, just to make sure that they are able to make ends meet. Just more structured types of payment that is more equal to all of the players on the team. There are simply too many downsides of paying each player based off of their value, and i dont think it would be something that would be easy to bounce back from for the NCAA. All this being said, the NCAA has to stop being stingy with their money and simply treat the athletes better. If this was the case, this would not even be a discussion. In conclusion however, i feel that the NCAA should not pay college athletes, at least in the same way pro players are paid.",37,9,26,0,2,4,2,2,1,1,0.0,0.7027027027027027,0.05405405405405406,0.39664082687338503

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, it's a two way street when it comes to our screened devices. In one way, we can argue that the screens we have everyday make our lives easier, more entertaining, and more productive. On the other hand, too much screen usage makes our social interactions more limited and less meaningful. So it is a delicate balance of how much is too much of the ever evolving digital world, and there isn't yet a standard for how much screen time is healthy.

In recent news, China has banned children under the age of 18 from playing online games. Is this cruel and unfair? Definitely. But is this because of an over-abundance of screen time causing the addiction and consequently the behavioral issues that we see in our youth today? It's also a possibility. That's why it's always a two-fold and multi-faceted discussion when it comes to something that can become exponentially more influential, powerful and persuasive with time.

What I suggest is that parents, companies, and the government should step in and try to change the nature of our screen habits, before this new digital world starts overtaking the more traditional ways of life of our evolution. The company, Facebook, has started removing the notifications feature on their home screen because of all the incessant distracting ""Likes"" and ""+1's"". Google has also implemented the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature to help you turn off your phone at night, if that's what you want to do. However, these steps are just the initial steps and the companies need to do more to ensure that we aren't getting lost in our digital world.

China's banning of people under the age of 18 from playing games is an extreme and drastic step to take, and I wouldn't want to see this type of action taken in the United States. Instead, a federal law to urge app makers and companies to monitor the screen habits of our youth might be more effective in preventing things like compulsive gambling, compulsive shopping, compulsive texting, and any type of addiction that leads to more unnecessary screen time.

Educators and parents should also step up to ensure our kids are not losing valuable time in their development, health, and social life because they are lost within the confines of their screens. A more hands-on approach and a more sensitive level of mentorship for our youth can reduce the let-down from our digital world by introducing more hands-on experiences and personality. If you are a parent, spending more time and having activities with your kid would help them spend less time on their phones.

To recap, I never want any banning or any drastic measures for people to limit their screen time. It doesn't work and it will not deter people from not using their devices. Instead, we should talk about the nuanced, more specific and technical aspects about how to balance the modern lifestyle with the ways of our ancestors. This can be done by analyzing and studying different aspects of life like our social interaction, our health, and our cognitive ability, where all of these three aspects are intertwined. Having devices with screens will not go anytime soon, but I just hope for the sake of our survival, devices will play a more positive role in our daily routines instead of the other way around.",30,6,6,1,17,22,19,3,0,19,0.03333333333333333,0.2,0.6,0.4885145482388974

I was shocked by what I was reading because everyone assumed JFK was dead. Not only was he assassinated on live TV, but he would be so old by now he may have even passed away due to old age. Perplexed by this, I called up my secret service detail to see if they knew what this was all about.  In the meantime, I ran to my closet and put on a nice seersucker suit because I wanted to look fashionable if this were true and i was going to meet such a legend. 

While I was getting ready and gathering some things, I got a call on cell phone. It was the secret service but not someone from my detail. The agent on the phone said they knew what was going on and asked me to walk outside and I should see a Dominos delivery car.  Confused, I hung up and walked outside. and lo and behold, a Dominos car was right in front my my door. It was driven by a man in a suit and sunglasses. 

He gets out of the car and says ""Barack Obama Sir. I was sent to pick you up. Please come with me.""

I agree and sit in the car. The man drives me to the airport but we do not go in the usual way. He pulled up to a fountain nearby and honked his horn twice. After that, a tunnel rose up from the fountain, revealing a secret road going beneath the fountain. The tunnel dropped us off at a private airstrip of sorts. We were totally underground but I could see a large door in the ceiling and a helicopter was waiting for me. I was brought to the chopper and the engine revved up right away. 
The chopper took off and I could see the cityscape beneath me as we rose up into the sky.
 and out of the door in the ceiling. I asked where we were going and the pilot told me it was top secret and he could not divulge that information; JFK wanted to keep things hush hush. I was confused but excited at the same. time.


The chopper flew for a few hours and we floated over a large body of water.
 The chopper then began to descend and I could see a small island in the distance. We landed on a helipad that was outside of a concrete building that looked like a bunker. There was seemingly nothing else on the island. Once the engine shut off, the pilot ushered me off and another man in a suit was waiting to escort me. He greeted me and then had me follow him down a path towards what looked like the front door. 

When we got to the door, he knocked three times and it slid open with no one the other side. The man brought me down a long hall and into an elevator. We took the elevator down a few stories and the man explained to me that ""the others"" will be waiting for me in the conference room a few stories down.

When the elevator stopped, the doors opened and I was in a large room with a table in it. Sitting at the head of the table was a man I thought I recognized. He beamed and walked over to the elevator door to greet me.

""Hello Mr Obama, thank you for coming on such short notice. I am John Kennedy."" I stared at the man. He was indeed JFK, standing right in front of me.

""What is going on?"" I asked confusedly.

""Let me explain everything, I think everyone is here.""

JFK motioned for me to sit down and he began a speech. I blacked out for a second and woke up in my bed back at home. It was all a dream.

The wolf opened the door and walked into the house.

When the little pig heard this, she knew it was safe. She opened the door and said, ""Oh, you're a frog now. Let me get the door for you so you can go to the water.""

One day, she finds out the truth.  It was quite disconcerting.  She was sitting on her living room sofa with her boyfriend, Ted watching a movie and eating popcorn.  Ted was holding the bowl.  She turned to say something to him, and instead of the blonde haired, blue eyed, light complected man of average height she was dating, there sat a tall, dark haired man with a closely cropped beard.  He was wearing the same clothes as Ted.  He was holding the popcorn bowl like Ted, but he didn't look anything like Ted.

She hopped up off the sofa.  This couldn't be Ted, but at the same time it couldn't NOT be Ted.  She had been sitting next to this man the whole time.

""Sue,"" he said in a voice quite different than Ted's, ""what's wrong?""

She pointed at him with a trembling finger.  He looked down and realization dawned across his handsome face.

""Sue,"" he said.  ""Don't be afraid.  It's me.  I know I look different than I did a moment ago, but I'm still the same person that you've been dating for the past two months and the same person who sat down on the sofa an hour ago.  I admit, I look different, but it's still me.""
She looked at him, then at the popcorn bowl, then back at him.
  ""I don't understand,"" she said.

He took a deep breath and motioned for her to sit back down.  ""I'll tell you,"" he said.

He went on to explain that he was born a shapeshifter, like his father had been.  As a child, it was hard for his parents to keep track of him.  He couldn't go to school, because when he was little, he didn't fully understand that not everyone had the same ability as he did.  Once he was old enough to understand, he didn't always have control over when he shifted.  By the time he was a teenager, he had good control but on rare occasions, it would happen unexpectedly, like it had tonight.  

Sue seemed shocked but given what she had just seen, she knew that Ted was telling the truth.  She'd seen it with her own eyes.  Seeing that she was accepting what he had told her, Ted went on.

""First, my real name is Kyle Wilkerson.  The reason I didn't tell you my real name is because I have loved you for many years and dated you four times before and it didn't work out.  I was Liam, Joe, Henry and Bob before we met while I was calling myself Ted.  I'm really sorry, but I wanted to be with you so badly that I kept trying.""

ue was stunned.
  She had dated this man four times before?  She thought back and realized that each of those men after Liam had seemed to know her better than the one before.  Now she realized it was because each one DID know her better, as they had spent time together.  Ted looked anxious as Sue sat in thought.  Finally she told him that she was touched that he wanted to be with her so badly that he kept trying over and over again, but that for now she needed him to leave so she could think things through.  Ted, or actually Kyle, stood up.

""Also,"" she said, ""what is your true form?""

He explained that he didn't know, because he had changed so often that he didn't really know what he looked like.

""What form do you feel most comfortable in?""

Before her eyes, he shrunk a couple of inches.  His hair stayed dark brown, but some light highlights appeared as it grew near shoulder length.  His nose got a little longer, his eyes changed to an emerald green.  He was stunning to look at.

""I am going to think about what I should do,"" Sue said.  ""But if I see you again, I want you to be in this shape, because this shape is what you are most comfortable in.""

Kyle smiled at her as he walked out the door.  She closed it behind him and leaned against it.  She had a lot to think about.
She went to bed that night and slept fitfully.
  She thought it was unlikely she'd ever find a man that wanted to be with her so badly.  A few days later she called him and they met for coffee.  He looked like the person he'd last shifted into, and she told him that she was willing to start over and see where it went.

They eventually married and had three children.  Sue now understood what Kyle's mother went through, as one of the three was a shapeshifter, too.  She had realized that might be the case so she was prepared, but little Ted was definitely more of a handful than his two non-shapeshifting siblings.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 

The first sign of the new power is the ability to slow time down for about 6 seconds. This can be useful in many situations. For example, one man was about to crash his car into a tree but was able to slow time down just as a result of his panic This allowed him to open the door, roll out of the car, and land softly in some bushes while his car exploded into a million pieces, none of which was a part of himself.

The fourth sign of the new power is the ability to shoot fireballs from one's hands.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

The utility of audiobooks depends upon whether one is listening to fiction or nonfiction. For nonfiction books, listening is a fully functional way of absorbing the material. For fiction, however, listening is a poor substitute for reading.
The reason for this is that the experience of reading a book is not just about absorbing the information., but to read good fiction is to inhabit another world. I think that listening to a book is a good way to get the gist of the material, but it is not a good way to experience the book as a lived reality. The reader is transported to the world of the book, and the reader is able to experience that world in a way that is not possible by just listening to a narration.

In an audiobook the reading experience is necessarily a mediated one. The narrator supplies pacing, emphasis, even accents. The narrator is the voice of the book, and the reader is not.

I think that the narrator's view of the material is valid and important--for them, not necessarily for me. I don't want to hear the narrator's voice, I want to hear the author's.

Reading a book is an activity that is both creative (supplying our own history and interpretation) and collaborative. But that essential collaboration is with the author--and only with the author.

Think about the last time you read--really read-- a book. For me, it was Stephen King's Dark Tower series, thousands of pages over eight novels. Picking up that story was pleasant because I was entering another world. I did listen to parts if that audiobook, and was underwhelmed because the voice of the narrator was not the voice I had heard in my head.

In closing,  think that the experience of reading a book is a fundamentally different experience than listening to an audiobook., because it is fundamentally an act of co-creation, and not merely the ingestion of facts

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, the written word is best.  It is my preference. I believe it gives a richer experience. Also, reading a book is somewhat like immersing oneself in the world of the author.

There is however something to be said to listening to audiobooks.  Sometimes hearing something said gives one a different perspective.  Additionally, sometimes you can listen when you can't read.  For example, the lights may be out or one is suffering from eyestrain.  Mostly though, I think people listen to audiobooks while they are doing something else hence their attention is divided.  Therefore, they don't get the full experience from the story or the book.  I believe you need to put your full attention into it.

Audiobooks are of course a boon to those with learning disabilities or those who are vision impaired.  Audiobooks open a world that is otherwise largely closed to them.  We should support them for that reason if no other.  The rising popularity of audiobooks among the general population has done just that.  Therefore the visually impaired or learning disabled have a much larger field to choose from where once it was quite small and very expensive. Many of the rare and out of print books have been converted to audio for example.

Audiobooks in short are a good thing.",24,7,13,0,4,7,4,3,1,3,0.0,0.5416666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.6052631578947368

The 92nd pig said ""Yeah, so you are the one who ate my brothers and sisters except my 3rd brother. He was the only other one who had any sense in his head after all."" 
The wolf was like, ""Dude, I had no choice.
 We all have to eat, right?"" The 92nd pig said ""Sure, but there is a lot of meat at the market you could have eaten and didn't have to eat my siblings.""

""Sorry about that I guess"" said the wolf "" but as you are a scientist, you must understand evolution and why my instincts made me do it."" The 92nd pig said ""Of course I do, but I also understand evolution is constantly changing every thing. Were is you mask by the way? We are in a pandemic you animal.""

The wolf laughed, ""I don't need it because I am going to huff and puff and blow your house down, for my next meal, I'm hungry from all the talking.""

So the wolf huffed, and puffed, and opened wide to blow down the 92nd pigs house. As he opened his mouth, the pig launched a mini nuke into his mouth, and that was the last of the wolf.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, animals, particularly pets, are helpless. Compared to a human that can use their mind to assess the best action while being beaten, an animial can not easily escape a raging human. Animals can not do wrong in a moral sense. Humans, on the other hand, are flawed. 

People may beat other people and animals because they believe the beating will make the person change, or because they are angry.  There is, however, no reason ever, to harm either man or beast.  On the contrary, any steps to reduce suffering, whether human or nonhuman, should be taken. It is wrong to beat a living being. In fact, in America, this is referred to as assault and is against the law. The assailant can be fined and jailed.  So, hurting others is both lawless and immoral. 

I think it is normal to have a disparity in the amount of concern for a suffering animal or person.  It would be wrong if a person chose to save an animal over a human. People are higher beings, spiritually.  They are higher on the food chain and the moral chain, if there is such a thing.  Animals and humans are not equals.

Ultimately, doing deliberate harm is wrong and unnecessary. I do not believe in such violence.",24,7,13,0,4,5,4,1,2,2,0.0,0.5416666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.5451713395638629

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. I was not that religious, so my attitude toward the teaching Brothers was less than optimal. I was smart as well as a smart ass.

But then I met Brother Marian. He was a slight man, and walked crookedly as if he had been a polio victim or had Parkinson's. There was always a few flakes of dandruff on his black suitcoat under his disheveled brown/blonde hair. He taught English Literature. From the first day of class, I felt accepted. He was smart, kind, gentle, and full of centered peace. He was a good teacher and a good man.

My situation at the time was bad. Alcoholism, mental illness and poverty had wracked my family and I often spent hours aimlessly riding my boke through the surrounding neighborhoods because my mother incessantly told me to go out and play with my (nonexistent) friends. I was lonely, confused and hopelessly sad.
Brother Marian wseemed to care about me. Something new developed within me during Brother Marian's class, something valuable and hitherto in very short supply.

The alien is not aware that Matt Damon is a very important person to the human race.
 This is because Matt Damon has incredible talents. He is funny, personable and can even cast magical spells. He is also a master of disguise and can be anyone he wants to be. For example, Matt Damon can morph into a clown, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a schoolteacher, or anyone else depending on his mood.

They are called the ""Matt Damon Retrieval Team"" and they are the most elite group of humans on the planet.

There weren't any visible people, only humans have useable opposable thumbs these days..soooo....?

I simply kept watch. I sat out beside the cow's enclosure after feeding them, but did NOT milk yet. I simply kept hidden behind my Crape Myrtle bush, quietly watching.  Sure enough, I heard a rustling, the cows looked up and then, miracle of miracles, milk began to fill the pail that had also miraculously appeared seemingly floating.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.
The story begins with a young man named Riku, who lives in a world where magic has long been forgotten.
 He has been raised in Landro by his grandfather Frezna, a wizard, and has always dreamed of becoming a great wizard himself.  Riku didn't know what had ever happened to his parents; his grandfather refused to tell him.  He lived a lonely, isolated life and longed for a family outside his grandfather.  There were no photographs of his parents; the only picture was of a woman.  Sometimes he would see his grandfather gazing at the photograph, a wistful look on his face.  

His grandfather spent years training him, but it takes a long, long time to learn everything one needs to know to use magic to its full extent.  When Riku was 14, his grandfather passed away.  Riku had been kept at home his whole life and knew little about the world, but now he had to set out and find his way.  He decided to go to the city of Faltra, where he had heard from his grandfather that there were many people who could teach him about magic.
Riku's first day in Faltra is a disaster.
  They spoke a different dialect than he had learned growing up, so it was very difficult to get around.  He did have a little money and was finally able to find a room to rent.  He knew he needed to find a job, and find someone to continue teaching him magic.  Over the next few weeks, he learned the dialect and started to find his way around the city.  He got a job at a bakery, where he worked hard and met a lot of people as he waited on them.  He made friends with a young girl named Selphie, who was a waitress at the bakery.  They became friends immediately, and it was almost like they had known one another forever.

One day, Selphie invited Riku to come to her house for dinner.  Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.

""Riku,"" she said.  ""Is it you?""

""Have we met?"" Riku asked?

""Have you come here from Landro?""

""Yes,"" Riku said.

""Is Frezna your grandfather,""

""Yes,"" Riku responded.

""Where is he?""

""He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.""

The woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  

Riku and Selphie were overjoyed to be reunited, and they spent the evening talking and catching up. Riku and Selphie spent the next year honing their magic and making plans for how to use their powers to return Mana to its past glory.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, there is no single most important subject in school. Each subject works in conjunction with every other subject that a child learns. As time goes by, they begin to specialize in their area of interest. Further education tends to be more pointed, but it's a student's choice where that point lies on the spectrum. That being said, maybe the best a school can do for a student is to instill a desire to continue seeking knowledge. With that in mind, I would say that a good course track in critical thinking would be one of the most important things to teach students, but in conjunction with something that fosters creative curiosity. 
I think that the most important thing I learned in school was how to learn new things.
 It wasn't until college that I actually took a course labeled as critical thinking, which was categorized as a philosophy credit. I believe that my educational experience would have been more satisfying had I been exposed to critical thinking, as an academic subject, much earlier in my career as a student. This would allow for a hands-on approach to the concept of thinking critically and understanding how to apply it.

Critical thinking, by itself, would not have been enough. I would also need to remember that it is the ideas that I generate myself, that are unique to me, that allow me to communicate who I am. Music and other arts have been stripped out of the curriculum of a lot of schools, leaving mainly creative writing as the only state sanctioned outlet for creativity. Creative pursuits should never be removed from the course catalog, because that is one of the foundations of learning how to learn. 
As I got older, I learned the power of being able to freely think through problems and challenges that I encounter.
 Today, I use critical thinking skills that I learned in college to help me traverse the massive amounts of information, and dis-information, that is available to me. With all that information sinking in, I need somewhere to put it. Music gives me that outlet, along with creative writing and some other, occasional, artistic pursuits. Those subjects have helped me to become a lifelong learner. I don't have all the answers, however I can always figure out where to go to get them.

In closing, I do not believe that there is any one, most important subject. I believe that critical thinking and creativity need to be the backbone of everything, and those require attention. Children starting out today will face a world that is faster and much more information centric than any previous generation. These subjects will help them to keep up, while also maintaining the ability to think for themselves.",29,6,18,1,4,6,5,1,0,5,0.034482758620689655,0.6206896551724138,0.1724137931034483,0.4807692307692308
1231,1ca38e46688e4a758b4c626ce2ba2ff6.jsonl,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, the question of whether some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport is really one about degree. How dangerous are they? There's something that is dangerous but widely accepted such as school sports. Even though you might break a bone (or fracture something), we know that statistically we'll be ok. Then there's more extreme sports such as base jumping, mountain climbing and wingsuit flying. Those are the other end of the spectrum. There, we know that there is a non-zero chance we will die. There's always the possibility. 

So if we divide sports into somewhat dangerous and very dangerous, then we can start to look at if it is selfish to participate. We might think that if someone dies doing something, they brought it on themselves. Especially if it is an extreme sport. There's people who have died going over Niagra Falls in a barrel. I think we'd all agree that didn't serve some greater purpose. However there are people who go mountain climbing not for glory, but as a challenge to themselves. It's a personal goal. Is that selfish? It's hard to say. Then there's people who do these things to make money. Some people make money filming themselves hanging from famous landmarks or parachuting from them. Again, is that selfish? They are doing it to make money for themselves or their family. 

I think that only extreme sports could be considered selfish and that's still debatable. It's also important to consider why people do these things. Everyone has a reason that maybe we don't understand. Maybe it's to support their family. Maybe it's to try and grow as a person by achieving a goal. Maybe they're just suicidal and think even the small chance of death is worth it. There's countless reasons so it's hard to broadly judge someone or to call them selfish. 

This is a free country and we're allowed to do what we want. People may say its selfish but that doesn't mean it actually is. We just have our opinions at the end of the day, right or wrong. ",34,5,20,0,9,11,9,2,0,9,0.0,0.5882352941176471,0.2647058823529412,0.49209932279909707

Paying college athletes is an idea whose time has come.
In “College Athletes Should Be Paid,"" David J. Leonard wpoints out that te NCAA and its member institutions have long profited
 from the labor of student athletes and argues that it is unfair to expect them to work for free. The argument seems persuasive. But if you look closely at the objects to paying student athletes, most of them address the corrupting influence of the money on the students themselves - fast cars, drugs, the highs life - and not the fact of paying them.

So why not let schools pay the athletes, but require the money to be held in trust for them until they either graduate or turn 35, whichever comes first? This eliminates NCAA exploitation while addressing the real concerns about whether student athletes will be changed for the worse by their suddenly high incomes.

What about the argument that poorer schools would be forced out of the market? If the schools can't afford to pay the athletes, they shouldn't be in the business of college athletics. Schools already compete for the best and brightest, and recruit actively, regardless of their endowment levels. Adding player salaries to the mix would not change this, just introduce a new element to the mix. And placing the money in trust would serve further to level the field.

I would say the best way to deal with that though, because I understand kids can be bullies for some reason in school, is for the schools to provide a private and safe place for girls that are experiencing what some may call humiliating situations. Also to keep it under wraps, and not let the information get out to the general public. This way the girls won't even have to worry about it, they can just go and get what they need, and leave.

So yeah, I am firm on my stance that schools should provide free pads and tampons to those girls who need it. They provide other free provisions for the students like toilet paper, soap, band aids, etc. so why not provide free pads and tampons to those students who would have a hard time without them anyways. The programs are subsidized by the government for a reason, which is to help people that are in need and can't afford those products. Even more, it could also help the schools case to try to raise school funding also. Help make the schools a safer place for the girls.",20,7,7,0,6,7,6,1,1,5,0.0,0.35,0.3,0.48284960422163586

It just so happens, that he's kidnapped once every few years, and the government has a secret agency dedicated to bringing him back. They're called the Men in Black, and they're the best in the business. The moment Damon isn't where the telemetric scanner says he should be for a period of more than 2 minutes, an alarm goes off, and the MIB are called in. Jets are scrambled, alert status is activated, and the best agents are sent to the scene.

Meanwhile, Matt Damon is being held captive by an alien who saw him in the movie The Martian, and decided he'd be a good addition to his collection. He's wanted a human for a long time, and Matt Damon seems to be a particularly interesting specimen. He's being held in a cage, and is being fed a steady diet of potatoes, which he hates. It turns out the alien saw him in a movie where he loved potatoes, and thought that he really did, but once this misunderstanding is cleared up, the rations improve.

Back on Earth, the MIB have arrived at the scene, and are looking for clues. One agent finds something. It's a potato. They don't know this, but the alien attempted to lure Matt Damon with it, and once that failed, resorted to the brute force tactic of a stun ray. The potato is a dead end, but the MIB are nothing if not thorough. Another agent finds something else. It's a set of footprints leading to the crime scene. They're clearly not human,  so the alien wing of the MIB springs into action.

Meanwhile, the situation on the spaceship is deteriorating. The alien finds that Matt Damon is a terrible conversationalist, and is getting bored. He also finds that Matt Damon is nothing like the character he played in the Martian, and is a fussy eater to boot. He begins to have second thoughts about the kidnapping.

At their secret base on Earth, the MIB have managed to track the alien ship to a position in low orbit. They launch a spacecraft to board the ship, and begin the mission to rescue Matt Damon. Once aboard, the alien greets them. He says he's happy to see them, and that he's glad to be rid of Matt Damon. The agents decide to accept the situation, and let the alien go.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, the above argument is persuasive. I feel rather strongly on my opinion that college athletes shouldn't be paid. I thought it was for the love of the sport. There was a time in this country when athletes were paid barely a living wage. When they simply played and competed because they loved what they were doing. When students agree to compete at the college level, it should be because they love their sport and want to contribute to their new school, first and foremost. If the student doesn't believe their new team is worth their time, unless they are getting paid, they will put in less effort and be less likely to form real bonds with team members.

Many athletes at the college level are also already being paid, in a sense, in terms of scholarship money. These students are receiving free educations based on their athletic talents and abilities.  An opportunity that other students don't have. The reason people go to college should be to gain a better education, not as a way to make money based on athletics. Many students that are attending these schools are very talented in ways other than sports, as well. To pay them separately based upon their athletic abilities alone seems unfair. It is unfair to the students being paid since they will only be seen for their sport. It is unfair to students who don't have physical talent, since their will be ignored further and left out of the limelight. 

One of the arguments in the article above really stuck out to me, and that had to do with schools that weren't able to pay large sums of money to get the best athletes.  That can be taken further to being unfair to the sports that are being paid less than what they are worth. Early in high school students may focus only on bettering themselves in a sport that will pay top dollar in college, and other school sports will be neglected and not get top athletes. Competition seems to rule in this country. Paying college students to play, takes the competition out of the sports all the way from high school and on. It is a disservice to other students who don't play, and it will make students less likely to appreciate a college education or to focus on their studies.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.
  There are medical professionals on hand to treat the boxers.  There are referees who are supposed to protect the health of the boxers as much as possible.   The trainers of the boxers have the ability to stop the fight by ""throwing in the towel"".     


I think if extreme activities like mountain climbing have proper safety regulations in place, they should definitely be considered sports.  ",21,5,14,0,2,7,2,5,1,1,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.09523809523809523,0.48484848484848486

In my opinion, technology has greatly improved dating. I've found that dating apps in particular increase the odds of finding a relationship, at least for me. Just having the ability to use Tinder or Bumble takes away the nerves from introducing yourself to someone in person. Breaking that ice is what I find the most difficult. Being able to talk to someone via a messaging app gives me a good indication on whether or not we are compatible.

Obviously there is still stress when it comes to dating even with the advancement of technology. Ultimately, no matter how well you know someone via the internet or via messaging apps, that first meeting is person is very nerve wracking. 
I think technology does a really good job in helping alleviate anxiety, but it never fully prepares you for a first impression.
 I may be extremely comfortable speaking to someone via text or messenger but may be too nervous in person and those nerves could show.

Personally, I have had a ton of experience as I am now 30 years old. I felt that over time I got less nervous. It's kind of like anything. The more you do something the more confident you get. I remember my first date I actually spoke to a girl online a ton. Meeting her I was so nervous because I really liked her and felt she liked me as well. We finally met and things went pretty smoothly, much better than I was expecting considering how nervous I was. I look back at that first date and laugh because I was putting so much pressure on myself for no reason.

Technology lets us break the ice and then ultimately when you're on the date you just have to be yourself. The other person is probably just as nervous as you are. After all, nobody wants to embarrass themselves or come across negatively on a first date. Of course there are first dates that just don't go well. That's a part of life. 

But overall, technology has definitely helped me in my dating experiences. My current girlfriend I met on Tinder. I swiped right, she responded back to me and we were off to the races. And the funny thing is, if you think about it...we never would have even met if it weren't for technology.

In my opinion, technology has made dating easier. Before technology I found it hard to date in a small town. Once I started looking online that all changed. I was able to find someone who lived in my area and had similar interests. It expanded my social circle. It wasn't always a love connection but I found friends I otherwise wouldn't have met before. 

I feel that people need technology to date at this point in life. It's a way to look without the risk of embarrassing yourself. You probably are too shy to approach a stranger on the street but you can message them and get to know them without the risk of rejection. It basically gives you the chance to be more social in general. 

I believe that it's good to explore your options online. What if the love of your life was in the next town? You'd never know it if it wasn't for dating apps. It just opens up your options.

As long as you are safe and smart about it, I don't see anything wrong with using dating apps. Like with all technology, you just have to be careful with who you interact with and what information you put out there. I think we all know those safety rules at this point though so they should be second nature. So just follow your instinct and give it a try.

They kept saying that they were drawing lines in the sand, but there was no sand. It made no sense.

Damon negotiates a little bit with the alien and tells him that as long as he can go back to his home planet, he will make a sequel.

Technology is a double-edged sword. The smartphone has given us the ability to replace great interpersonal connections with dehumanizing ones and can put a damper on relationships. However, it also allows us to connect with people we otherwise wouldn’t.

 think it is important to have multiple types of relationships and interactions to maintain proper self-care.
 It is important not to allow all of our social connections to come from the digital realm. Technology is a great tool and is more than just a distraction from our interpersonal relationships, but I think it should be used in a healthy moderation. 
Technology is great because it has enabled communication.
 Before smartphones and texting I would speak to my partner only when we were together. Now with texting and snap chat, I can communicate with him during when we are apart. echnology can also be used to avoid issues or challenges with a relationship.
 If we have a disagreement while we are with each other we can text or email instead of arguing in person. It gives us time to cool off, and re-read what we want to say. This way we can have a much less intense argument and deal with the issue in a civil manner.

Technology is a wonderful thing but can also be used dnegatively  I think there are also many negatives with the communication aspects of social media. It can make relationships superficial. I don't feel ""face to face"" conversation is as important to people as it used to be. We often end up communicating in these short texts that doesn't require as much effort and thought.  Posts can also be misinterpreted.

Dating apps often make dating seem like a one-sided, automatic process.
 It makes it easier to feel like dating is a game. If someone doesn't respond within a day or two, you move on to the next person. You don't get to know the person as well as you would in a normal situation.
he amount of technology being used today hinders the normal dating process.
 With dating apps all that matters is you swiping left or right to get to the next person. 


There are pros and cons of technology.  We should carefully weigh the benefits to make sure they outweigh the negatives.

In my opinion, there are activities that put an undue burden on the community. Playing football, baseball, hockey or other team sports is relatively low risk, and tend to be good for a community. Those sports give people something do do, whether as spectators or as participants. Other sports are more of a daring pursuit, where an individual, or group of individuals, test some extreme element and put themselves at great risk. They also run the risk of becoming a burden to society. They may fill a hospital bed that would be needed by someone else, or they may require expensive emergency transport, that they cannot afford. The cost of their injuries fall not only on them, but on us. In order to keep those kinds of sports going, we, as a society would have to subsidize them.

These activities may have some value as spectator sports, but that value is outweighed if there are a large number of injuries, or even deaths, that occur as a result of their practice. Although the desire to promote or practice these sports may be an individual decision, society has a responsibility to regulate them. It is our infrastructure that is put to the test when something goes wrong. Communities to not sacrifice resources to build hospitals, roads and emergency systems for this purpose. The cost falls on all of us.

Personal freedom is important, and most would agree that it is central to American life. The problem arises when a person's individual liberty, and the extent to which they exploit their freedom, begins to drain community resources. In other words, when the ability to pursue a chosen lifestyle causes a drain on the system that depends on it to function, society can impose its interests. Society has a duty to do so. 
Personal freedom has limits and those limits can be derived in a fair and democratic way.
 That is why we vote. We vote with the interest of the community, as a whole, in mind. That is the only responsible way to make those choices. Otherwise, there is no limit to the freedom an individual might want to claim. They may claim that they can choose to hurt other people, however indirectly, in pursuit of their own goals. That is wrong. It is not a meaningful expression of freedom. That is an attack on the institutions that allow us to live freely. Extreme sports need to be analyzed and dispositioned by the community, as a whole.

In my opinion, absolutely they should. They are literally personal hygiene products that teenage girls need access to when the time comes. School would be the worst place for a female student to have an issue like this. It could ruin a poor child's life for an extended period of time if a visible accident were to happen.

Barack also remembers reading the same phrase in a super top secret cable from MI6. It stated that Ronald Regean and George H.W. Bush were seen netting with the head of the Chinese government and Taiwan.
This is what Barack found inside the letter. It said to call this number after taking care of any remaining, personal business. It also suggested that you say your goodbye's just in case. While that last part made Barack very hesitant, he decided it was in his and the nations best interest for him to follow through. He then calls, the phone is picked up by a secretary with a real loud, strong Boston accent and directed his call to the head of the Presidential Afterlife establishment. Barack enters the office and sees JFK but he is about 20 years younger then when he was president. He sits Mr. Obama down and fills him in. This department is the most highly secretive one in the world. When presidnets die they are cloned and have all their knowledge and experience transferred to the younger, immortal body.

College athletes are in many ways comparable to athletes older than them, that participate in professional leagues outside of colleges and universities. Many of college athletes put in tremendous amount of effort and their time to improve their abilities, and to seek achievement of the sport of their choosing. This effort and time is primarily reflected in the outcomes of the sport for the colleges they are associated with, whether it is the games they win for their teams, or the records they may break in other types of sports. 
College athletes are also in many ways comparable to other students, who are not athletes.
 They still have educational obligations to meet apart from the demands of the sport, which in too can conflict with work demands if they hold one. Having to juggle a variety of obligations in a day can be tiring and stressful, which impacts the performance of a college athlete much like any other type of athlete. However, the college athletes that are not paid to the same degree as professional athletes like in the MLB, NFL, NHL, and much more will no doubt be subjected to much more stressors from the lack of finances. 
The argument that college athletes should not be paid ithat is ased on the idea that the current system of scholarships and other benefits is enough. is a flawed line of thinking. That is assuming that college athletes like other students, don't accumulate debt through other expenses apart from the ones necessary to pay for their education. Scholarships and other benefits are sufficient to pay for tuition and the cost of materials, but like other students, many of college athletes have other areas to attend to. This includes living arrangements, food, hobbies, and much more than will be difficult to pay for with scholarships and other benefits, more so for some than others. College athletes often will struggle between their obligations to make money if they aren't being paid for their efforts in the sport, given that a part-time or even full-time job is difficult enough for students with educational demands. Paying them like other athletes will help them meet the demands of their finances as it relates to their education, personal life, and their sport.
The argument that paying college athletes would ruin the sport is also flawed., given that such a concept exist in professional leagues and other sports. Universities benefit much from college athletes, more so from the ones that have high prestige, performance, and reputation. The bidding wars and other excessive costs that universities pay for their athletes are in part of their own vocation, something that can be prevented through more regulation, and effecitvely the fair treatment of all college athletes for their efforts. These can be reduced so that the university will not impact other students, while still being able to pay athletes for their efforts that is necessary for them to continue their sports career, while also furthering their educational career.",27,9,14,0,4,5,4,1,1,3,0.0,0.5185185185185185,0.14814814814814814,0.425531914893617

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" The pig said ""what do you want?"" The wolf yelled at the pig and said it was unfair that the pig built a house out of a material that can't be blown down.

The pig responded and told the wolf to leave him and his friends alone and find some new animals to pick on. The pig decided to spread the word to the rest of his friends. As the days went on, each pigs began to build their homes using depleted uranium. The wolf was very distressed and felt that he had lost his purpose in life. He had spent years blowing down little pigs homes. 

The wolf came back to the neighborhood and saw that all the homes were now made of depleted uranium so he started to do research on the internet. He had to figure out what he could do to blow depleted uranium down. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do to blow the home down. However he did find that he could destroy the homes by shooting fireworks at them.

He found that interesting but depleted uranium has a chemical reaction with fireworks that causes the depleted uranium to disintegrate.

The wolf went to the store and bought a bunch of fireworks. He decided to drive over to the neighborhood and go through with his plan. He had all of the fireworks in the bed of his truck. He lit the fireworks and shot them at the pigs homes but to his surprise the fireworks just bounced off of the homes and nothing happened.

The wolf was shocked and didn't understand what was happening. The pigs came out of their homes and told the wolf they had to tell him a secret. They went up to the wolf and told him that the homes weren't made of depleted uranium. They tricked the wolf and have found a material that cannot be destroyed no matter what the wolf does.

1259,8d93814aa76841fbb5fc1fbf3fc24a4a.jsonl,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, this 'debate' smacks of political correctness and posturing, rather than a real concern for the welfare of female students. Being male, of course I don't know what it's like to have a period, and I have never experienced period shaming, but I do know what it's like to be a teenager, and I went to school with plenty of girls who were having their periods for the first time. In my experience, ""period poverty"" was not a problem. Girls would occasionally have an ""accident"" and students would make fun of them, but junior high school students are cruel, and they make fun of everyone, for a variety of reasons.  Girls tended to be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of being mocked for having an accident, and I assume that they would carry around extra pads and tampons in case of emergency. So, the situation was mostly taken care of, by the girls themselves, and their families, or helpful peers.

I did not attend a private school, or a school in a wealthy area with exclusively wealthy students, in fact there were many low income students there, and they were able to handle this. Is it possible that in schools now,  the situation is different? I'm puzzled to explain why this would be. Are students poorer now? Are they more likely to be mocked by increasingly cruel peers? Are young women now more likely to be uniformed about their periods? Or are they just less responsible and less capable of taking care of themselves?

I suspect in this case, as well as with many others, the problem is not that the schools are failing to provide pads and tampons, but that the students are failing to take responsibility for themselves, because they are less well informed and responsible than they should be. This is not the schools' fault, it is the fault of the students and their parents. Schools can provide tampons or pads in case of emergencies, but they can't fix irresponsibility and lack of basic knowledge, that responsibility lies with these girls' families, and with the girls themselves.",23,7,3,1,12,25,16,9,0,16,0.043478260869565216,0.13043478260869565,0.5652173913043478,0.4489311163895487

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

You had always suspected there would be side effects. With a drug that strong, that amazing how could there not be? It was just a matter of time. It was always kind of a little solace that, even though you weren't going to live forever, that you had been too old for the drug, that at least you wouldn't have to deal with the side effects either. 
When the side effects are discovered, you're not a happy camper.
 At first there was a kind of collective experience when the government announced that side effects had been confirmed. That was all the initial press release said. People got really worried, and it was all any one talked about that day. 
The next day there was a press release stating that the side effects were really low level, that most people wouldn't even notice them, and
 that more information would be released in the next week or so. 

You, like most people, were impatient and didn't want to wait that long.

They were among the first to receive it; if there were side effects they would probably be experiencing them. 

It was hard to reach out to them. There had been a lot of bitterness back then, and jealousy. They were the ones who had gotten the thing you wanted, and it had made them very popular. But still, you needed to know. So you called Jack. He was one of the first to receive the drug. He had always been a little arrogant, but you could tell him anything.

""Hey Jack, I know we haven't talked in forever, but with all this news about The Drug, I just wanted to check in on you..."" you began.

The man on the other end started laughing. ""Yeah, right, your just hoping to hear something terrible has happened to me. But I get it buddy, I know it was hard all of those years ago to know you were going to get old, while I would stay 25 forever. Just human nature.""

You grit your teeth - he may be a dying jerk, but he was still a jerk. ""No, but really Jack, how are you.""

""Great, never been better. We're not supposed to tell people, but I can tell you are dying with curiosity, and given how old you are, I don't think your heart should be under that much strain. These quote, side effects, unquote, are great! It's like suddenly all of my senses are heightened, in a good way. Everything tastes better, everything I touch feels better, things smell great. Its truly amazing. Right as I was getting bored with this body and life, BAM, something happens to make me appreciate it all over again. Seems like it is going to be permanent too.""

---

In my opinion, we need to look at how it affects other people than just the athletes. Allowing athletes to be paid opens the door for money being taken away from other departments. This could make non-athlete students less likely to want to graduate or attend school. Athletes have the advantages in high school so it could make students angry that again they are being pushed aside in place of athletes. That's one big reason that we should never pay college athletes. 

Another reason is just that it would cause bidding wars. You've seen how those go when people are being recruited for professional teams. It would be the same thing for colleges. It would open the door to college sports just being all about who can spend the most money. 

It's also just an ethical issue in my opinion. There are students who are studying to save lives or to represent the people, yet we are paying people who play a game. It's just not fair to people who are studying to make the world a better place. 

If colleges are allowed to pay athletes, it will just lead to countless issues down the line. There's many that we can't even imagine that will arise in the future. The best thing is to just say no and never open that doorway. Once you do, you never know what will happen. The one thing we do know though is that it isn't fair to students who are not athletes.

In my opinion, listening gives me at least a broad range of thinking, When i read a book my mind tend to stray a lot but when i listening i feel i can imagine myself in the story and play the role of the character. I also have the option of not being tethered to a book and can walk around listening to it.  also think listening is good for people who can't read or have a hard time reading.
 For me listening to an audiobook on the treadmill just makes the time go buy super fast and its also a time killer to say. I am usually a visually person meaning videos help me cram info better than writing , i would also say i'm a listening person as well . So when listening i could hold things better than reading it. I also think listening to an audiobook is good for people who are in a hurry and don't have time to read. There are a wide array of advantages of listening, meaning it can be done on the go and from everywhere. When i have the choice i always go for listening to books and or podcast. The Audible app is godsent in my opinion, i find myself listening to so much more books that are sometimes free or have a promotion. I also find myself not buying the amount of books that i use to in the past since this new technology came about. I also find myself listening to books that i wouldn't have read in the past.

The odd thing was, after a while, the phone Mork used when first meeting Jill got a text from her, she seemed to be apologizing.  The next time he saw her as the Beckham iteration, she cooled toward him, telling him she'd met someone else. Well the someone else was him. She ended up going back to be with the earlier iteration of Mork, whom he was happy to shift back into, Little did she know that she'd never really lost him at all.

1265,c291ea51ad6c42a887c1fd2464edebe1.jsonl,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, people are more empathetic to an animal suffering because people feel that animals are like kids in a way. Animals are not really capable of fending for themselves or living on their own the majority of the time. So when an animal is suffering or beaten, it sort of is similar to a little baby being beaten. As far as people being more upset than they are to people, i think we are just desensitized when it comes to human suffering. We see it so often in the news, media, movies, etc. We kind of just feel it is normal, and we know that people are going to do mean things sometimes. I think in a way, if were to be so upset about it each and every time we would drive ourselves crazy mentally. Needless to say, people still do get upset at humans suffering as well, i think the actual news of it though is just a little densensitized. You dont hear about dogs suffering in the newspaper or on the news, but you do with people. I think we as people realize that animals are left out of media sometimes, so when we do hear about their suffering it is almost like it is in a spotlight. Also, people find animals to be much more innocent and adorable in comparison to humans. When you see a cute dog all you want to do is love it and protect it. I think part of this instinct comes from the fact that they cannot really fend for themselves often times, and need someone to help them. Its the same feeling you would get if you saw a infant that was left outside by itself, or if you saw someone harming a little baby. The baby can not protect itself, so your instinct is to go and help it. 

I personally dont feel it is wrong to focus on animal suffering, as i feel that if you are focused on helping anyone that is suffering it is a good deed. As far as where to dictate our funds as a country, i think it would be smarter to help people out. Helping people out would be an investment anyway, and this would allow those people who were helped to help out the animals. The more healthy people we have, the more homes we have for these animals. As far as testing products out on animals and what not, i think this is going to happen regardless. Unless we allow experiments on people, animals are simply going to have to take the burden here. The meat industry will probably never go away either. Humans were brought up eating meat, and there would be many deficiencies if we just stopped eating meat all together in my personal opinion. I get some people may be different, however i think that for the large majority of people meat consumption is important. The best thing we can do i would say would be to treat these animals right and give them great lives while they are here. So in conclusion, i dont think it is WRONG to focus on animal welfare, however i feel that human suffering is a larger problem.",32,7,25,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0.0,0.78125,0.0,0.39628482972136225

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, yes, listening to an audiobook is just as good as reading the paper pages of a book because it is the same story. You get the same information, and you can still enjoy the story. You still have to be involved with the story of course, just like you would if you were reading the pages yourself. 
I think that listening to an audiobook is bjusttas beneficialreading a book because iif you are just starting to learn to read, it's like you have a person reading along with you. Of course you should be reading the book yourself, along with listening to the audiobook at the same time. Pause and rewind as needed to give yourself time to read the pages. I personally know a person who taught themselves how to read using that method. It worked very well for them. 

I can not however say that an audiobook is better than good old fashion reading though because both do have minor differences about them like the fact that you can't see the words as you listen to the audiobook, or that you can't do other things while reading a book.
Pros and cons for both, but those do not make an audiobook better or worse than reading and vice versa. There really shouldn't be sides when it comes to any form of reading. People that say audiobooks are trash because you don't read it yourself must have forgotten when they were little kids and their parents read to them.

It would as they claim, help the body recover and regenerate faster from injuries, as well as reduce the likelihood of disease. Unfortunately, the drug was quite costly, and would not be affordable for the majority of the people of Earth. The drug was thus distributed primarily to the wealthy and rich, who could easily afford the drug. s is expected, the scientists that created the drug made large amounts of money in sales.
 Protests rang all across the world from those who could not afford the drug, demanding the drug makers to make the drug more affordable and accessible to all. Their pleas and protests went unheard, and overtime the protests ceased as people accepted they would not be able to take the drug to extend their lives.

The year is now 2078, and the drug has allowed many that could have afforded the drugs to live longer lives, some up to the age of 150. However, as they aged, the drug had not prevented the eventual deterioration of their mental processes. Many still possessed their physical strength and health, but their mental capacity was slowly slipping. They were unable to perceive the world around them, although there own bodies appeared to walk and move without their input. The drug makers had no real explanation for this phenomenon, but offered a simple fix. They assured the drug users that a new drug would become available that would treat their symptoms, and that would allow them to continue their lives normally. Many accepted it, and were soon administered the drug. However, time soon proved that the drug was nothing more than a placebo, and it did nothing to alleviate their symptoms. The drug makers were not able to produce a treatment or cure for the symptoms, nor did they feel a strong urgency to research further into finding one. Most of the users would eventually become unable to protest or complain to the company, and those that didn't take the drug had stopped caring about wanting to use it a long time ago.
As of now, the drug ihas ceased being distributed. Although some have found itself in Black Markets to be purchased at exorbitant prices, many have decided against buying the drug.

One day you awake to find yourself in a mysterious room, that isn't like your typical bedroom. In fact, the room is better furnished and seems much more expensive than the items you own. The massive flat screen in front of you is new, and you wonder how much it could have cost, much less how you could ever afford it on your personal income. Turning to your right you see a bathroom, and you get out of bed to examine this luxurious bathroom. The bathroom, like the bedroom is much more elegant than your utilitarian restroom, having a much more massive shower with its own tub. You glance at the mirror to inspect yourself, and you are shocked at what you see.

Staring in front of the mirror is none other than famous actor Matt Damon. Confused by this, you begin to think that maybe this is a dream. There is no logical way you could be Matt Damon, or even controlling his body. You were just an average person, who had an average life with an average job at the local hospital, not some renowned actor that earns millions per movie. 
Suddenly the door to your bathroom opens, and you are met by none other than your wife, Luciana.
 She wonders what is going on, as you normally do not spend so much time in the rest room inspecting yourself. You try to explain what has happened and how you have become Matt Damon, but she just looks at you crazily and does not believe you. She otherwise passes it off as an elaborate joke you are making, and suggests that you get ready to go to work.

Work, you ponder, it surely meant a film shoot, and not your usual job at the hospital. Your mind was racing trying to piece together this new reality you were thrust into, and you couldn't help but think that your were way over your head. Grabbing Matt Damon's smart phone, you noticed a missed call, who left a voicemail. The message was from your agent, Alex saying to get to the film shoot in about an hour as you are needed for an important shot. You then panic, as you get the address to the film set, and you head out. You drive in a car that you don't recognize, and get to the set on time.

There everyone seems relived to see you arrive, and they thrust you onto the set. You are told that your need to act for this film is very important, and the production company cannot stall any longer. You are then given little time to rehearse, and filming begins almost immediately. The performance you give feels mediocre to you, but the director and the rest of the crew find it satisfactory.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.

An example of a ""real"" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline sociopathic, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.
I think that's the key to a good portrayal of a character:
 you may like or hate them, but you care.

A contrary example is the protagonist of the fiction book ""The Good Lawyer"" by Thomas Benigno. The book is masterfully plotted, but the main character is a  cipher. I didn't relate to him and didn't care what happened to him. He could have been anyone. The book suffered and so did the reader.

So that's the test that matters: is the character real?  Do you  care about them? Great authors invariably say that their characters have a life of there own, and do things without the author intending them to do so. That's the sign of a great character.
What do you think?

That place being their uranium fortress. 
The wolves, they didn't know it yet, but the little pigs had been watching them.
 The pigs knew of the wealth the wolves had accumulated from eating weaker animals and then taking their fortunes for their own use. This angered the pigs, and many small animal all over the globe.

The home was fortified even more, making it impossible to escape once the alarms and traps had been set. The invitations to an exclusive, posh, wolves only resort were sent out to every wolf who had amassed great fortune at the expense of others. Over the next week, the wolves began to arrive. Paying what constituted their entire fortune the wolves were admitted to the exclusive 'spa' for a once in a lifetime experience. Or as the pigs later told in their tales of this exploit, an end of a lifetime experience. 
The wolves were shown to their rooms, and they began to make themselves comfortable.
 They were fed luscious meals, made from fake meat, and given all the treatment royalty would expect. When the last wolf of great wealth and power finally arrived, the terminal stages of the plan were set in motion. The pigs all left the fortress quietly in the dark of night.

 Suddenly my eyes open, and I am in my bedroom. I knew it, just a dream. I look to my dressor and see a mug. Of course, the #1 dad mug. I grab it and look at the name on it. It wasnt actually a name, but  some writing on the cup that was unfinished. I saw a J, and the o was being drawn although i saw no marker or pen. The letter kept appearing and dissapearing over and over, like some sort of magic. It was like it was trying to tell me something. Maybe that my job of being a father is unfinished. You see I am a father, but not a biological father. I married into having four step kids, whom i love each and every one of. I feel that i am a good father, and I know that i do my best each and every day to be one. I dont want to be the father that takes his kid to a ballgame once in a while and calls it good. I want to be the father that the kids look up to from the time they are young, until the time they are old. Not because they are nice, or fun, or cool. But simply because they are real, and they care about the kids no matter what. As this thought popped into my head another letter was drawn on the cup. Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me. I tried to remember what i was doing last when i fell into this dream like mode. Was I stressed, happy, anxious? Why am i deliberating how good of a dad I am? Just like that i woke up again, but this time really woke up. I asked my buddy where i was. He told me that i had taken some shrooms and was most likely hallucinating or in a trans....

You swat at the bees, but they fly back to their original formation. What is going on? You can't stop thinking about the man in the trench coat and fedora. What did he do to me?

So they send a robotic probe out to the other nations of the world, all of which have been destroyed by nuclear warfare. Eventually, the probe comes across a group of surviving humans who have formed a utopian society in Switzerland. The USA wants to learn how their society works and is willing to offer them a place in the world, but they say no. Thus, the United States realizes that it may very well be on its own again for the next 50 years or more, since Switzerland's society is not willing to engage and there are no other countries left in the world. 
The only solution, the USA believes, is to push mankind forward so that they can create a new world.
 To do so, the president of the United States has a bold plan. He wants to send some of the best minds from America out to space in order to establish a new form of life, a new hope. Thus, the plan is to create an orbital space colony, one that will be able to sustain life for thousands of years. 
A ""generation ship"", named the ""Ark"", is launched from Earth with enough supplies to sustain a population of one hundred thousand people.
 The president believes that in sending out Ark, he can allow the United States to maintain its power and place in the world even in a world that no longer really has a sense of global leaders to it. The Ark is headed away from Earth and begins its journey in the direction of the Sun. 
Some years later, the Ark's crew begins to realize that something is wrong.
 The spaceship seems to be malfunctioning. The Earth is no longer visible to them, and they begin to experience strange tremors and pressure changes. The people on board the Ark are fearful and begin to panic. There is a suicide epidemic, almost everyone has some sort of psychological breakdown. Soon the population is down to one thousand, then five hundred. Then, the Ark stops altogether.

The remaining five hundred people on board ban together. They realize that they must be the chosen ones. After all, they have been sent off to another planet by one of the sole countries remaining on planet earth to establish a new order, and they have lost so many men to this suicide epidemic that they don't know where to begin but know they have to try. So, they put together a plan. They will begin to search the ship for supplies and technology, as well as attempt to try and salvage the engine. 
They have radio contact with the president who suggests that they begin to build the new civilization on board.
 They are told that they can build anything they want and that this is their new home. These five hundred survivors are the chosen ones, and they must begin to settle and start a new life on this spaceship. These five hundred people call themselves the Arkians, and they certainly feel a great sense of honor to be able to embark on this task. Bit by bit, they salvage enough technology to be able to build the new order Ark right there on the spaceship. Society among the Ark flourishes under the leadership of the original 500 people, and they call themselves the Kingdom of 500. This Kingdom does much to advance the agenda of the United States back on planet Earth, and the president of the United States is lauded for his foresight in launching the Ark.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, while these activities are really dangerous, I do not think it is selfish for people to pursue them. They are freely deciding to partake in the activity and almost all sports already have an inherent risk of injury that comes along with them. Most, if not all of these sports that are considered more dangerous require you sign a waiver in addition to getting trained before doing anything actually dangerous. For example, rock climbing in my area requires you to train and then pass a test before you are allowed to go off on your own at any of the gyms. Because of this, the person is trained and understands the risks. I do not consider this selfish because they are just doing with their life what they want to do. Partaking in the sport does not directly impact anyone else other than themselves. 

While these sports are dangerous, the chance of injury is actually very low. You do not hear too much about someone dying while skydiving or rock climbing. The only time you hear about someone dying while doing these activities is when it is a freak accident which can occur in any sport really.

Calling participating in a sport selfish would be like saying driving a car is selfish. Or going swimming is selfish. Or drinking a beer is selfish. All of those activities are statistically more likely to cause harm to the person doing it but no one would consider any of those activities as selfish.  
I think that it is a personal decision to partake in these activities., just like partaking in any activity is. I do not like anything is inherently selfish unless you are purposefully forgoing others for the sake of yourself.  Deciding to do one of these activities is not forgoing anyone else and only directly affects you. That is why I do not find these type of things selfish. 
I think that if you are going to do one of these activities, you should be well trained and understand the risks.
 When you are prepared and understand the risks, just have fun and not worry, you are not being selfish at all. ",24,5,16,0,3,10,3,7,3,0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.125,0.4805491990846682

The ""World's Best Dad"" mug is now the ""World's Worst Dad"" mug.
 Although i am a dad, i am not a biological dad. I have four step kids that my wife is the biological mother of. I love them to death but can not claim them as being my own. I wondered what a dad would have to do to find themselves on the world's worst dad mug. I cant imagine someone having an identify of being a bad father or mother. To me it is the most important thing to me to be a good role model to the kids, so a spot on this list would be like a knife to the heart.  would like to see a list of the top 10 worst step dads. and a little video for each one of them, so they could explain what these people do as fathers. Most likely it would be not much of anything. But even doing nothing would probably put you above someone who is abusive violently or physically. It is just interesting to me. I wonder if there is a list of the worst step dads or moms. I imagine there are plenty of them out there. But to be a good step parent i feel is even tougher. I feel like not enough is talked about step parents. It is a very selfless and thankless role as you do not ever feel completely fulfilled as you would if the kid were your own. This is not said in a bad way towards the kids, but simply because you never actually have the final say when it comes to important decisions for the kids.  You also dont get a lot of the accolades that biological parents get. This being said, i love the kids, and they love me. They let me know it, i let them know it, and we are a very close family. I wouldnt change anything, i am just speaking my inner monologue. While all of this is going on in my head i think to check the mug for the worst dads. I see the mug has changed to show the actual ranking of Dads. I am confused. I am not sure why it keeps on switching in my eyes. I wonder if i am even looking at something real. I am not sure. I think about what it takes to be a top dad in the world today, and i think of sacrifice. I think of leading by example, and i think of faults. I think the best dads are simply ""real"". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the ""best"" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect. Nobody is perfect, so to try and act perfect is not realistic to kids. Showing your faults and showing how you fall down sometimes is so important. Maybe i deserve to be on this list? Not because i am a perfect dad, but simply because i give my best effort. I am ok with failing as long as i do my best. If i do my best, than i have no regrets. Regrets in life are like an illness.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should embrace the freedom offered by screens. We are finally able to keep at a distance those nosy neighbors, intrusive office workers and noisome family members. We can focus on ourselves and what we want. The age of Me is finally here again. We don't have to put on a false smile, unless we are zooming with someone. Otherwise we can look at what we want and do what we want. Even if someone is in the room with us, we don't have to acknowledge them. They also are on their screens, glued, hoping for a thumbs up, Like, or upvote. Things happening around them are inconsequential. 
We can now be alone with our screens, but not lonely.
   We can connect with friends, virtually, and make virtual friends. Getting together for a chat, texting back and forth, can help us feel more valid. It can relieve loneliness, we don't have to worry about relating to a roommate. We can simply text them, if we have an issue. No need for face to face when a simple text will do. Why worry. If we tire of a lover or virtual friend,  easy, no stress. We can simply ghost. It's easy, quick and painless. We feel nothing really, no worries. 

We can also connect with people we don't know, but who share our interests. We can imagine what we like in a person and pretend that the person we text or DM with is what we like. We don't have to worry about deep connections, getting along IRL, when virtual is better. We also can reduce worries of getting germs, dealing with things in a physical way, when that's not what matters now. Our ""views"" and buzz we create on Twitter is important. Followers count, not an actual handshake or real thumb pointing upwards, virtual traffic is the currency of today.  Embrace it. Love it.

Let's simply focus on us now. It's OUR time. So long to the centralized family, the crowded cubicle, and full bus, we can simply veg out in Jammies at home, occasionally putting on a clean shirt and prop ourselves in front of a virtual palm an boom, we are on vacation, or leading a team. Why bother with substance when appearances are all that matter. It's best to just embrace it, get on with it and excel. We can do that now. We can be the best, we can be the most popular. Why wouldn't we? Just do it.

Forget competing in real life just point to what matters, our likes, followers, Reddit Karma, that's what matters. We don't have to worry about real life, we can just be ourselves, the best version of ourselves. Pretending is fun, and we can finally be what we want, not what we are. I am all for embracing it. It's time to let us control things. Revenge of the nerds is where it's at, being virtual, NOT real. Embrace it and hone it.  Real life seems too hard. We can simply withdraw and redraw our lives to fit excitement, get on with it.",51,6,41,0,4,5,4,1,0,4,0.0,0.803921568627451,0.0784313725490196,0.46317512274959083
1283,ae3d56d704a74f80827bbc54d685bfc2.jsonl,"How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, all these things have done is further complicate the already complicated and awkward process of attempting to have some kind of romantic interaction with someone you are attracted to. Since the dawn of time, people have managed to establish intimate relationships by meeting each other in real life, gradually learning to trust one another, and eventually being at the point to where they really want to begin a relationship with each other. 21st century technological developments have only added a layer of bizarre complexity to this process, and have further isolated people to the point where this process fails before it can even begin.

Dating apps are the greatest example of this. I've used them, and the experience is not unlike playing online poker, or playing video games — the main point of it is to kill time in lieu of having better things to do. The way the time killing process works with them, is that, you open up the app, conveniently right around the time you would otherwise go to bed, and start swiping through dozens of unappealing or phony users until you find one or two that you like, and begin exchanging messages with them, which might then end in a flaky or disconnected face-to-face interaction, which might then end in a crappy date that doesn't lead to anything further, which then leads you back to the beginning with yet more profiles of people you don't have anything in common with, and who you don't really want to meet. This does nothing to build a foundation of trust and rapport, and it does nothing to help people connect with each other.

Netflix is a mere time waster, it's much like going to a video store, only with thousands of titles rather than hundreds, few of which either you or a prospective partner will have any interest in watching, and the whole process is more likely to result in awkward silence and resentment over poor viewing choices, than a romantic connection.  Texting is very much the same way — the only difference is that it sucks even more time out of your day, and takes more from your life, as you fail over and over to communicate with someone like a real human being, and wind up resorting to emoticons.

What all of these things have in common, beyond being ineffectual for dating or relationships, is that they are all means for some greedy corporate entity to make money, and ultimately if you build a real relationship, the money making will stop, so they have interest in facilitating relationships. The best response is to ignore them all, and meet someone in the gym, library, a book store, coffee shop, or on a hiking trail somewhere. Then, once you're in a relationship, you can rest satisfied, knowing that not only have you met someone you might spend the rest of your life with, you've also saved a ton of money in the process and helped to put Netflix out of business.",21,9,1,1,10,23,20,3,0,20,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.5238095238095238,0.4704861111111111

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we only have an obligation to keep up with the news, if it is relevant to us. That is, if you are in a position where you can profit off of or effect real change with information, you have an obligation to know what is going on to the extent that that knowledge, will help you do those things. f you are a CEO, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world. of business, and in the broader scheme of things that might affect your business. If you are a doctor, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of medicine. If you are a farmer, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of agriculture. If you are an actor or writer or singer, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of entertainment.  What then if you're an ordinary citizen?

Well, then you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world that might affect you or that of people who might be close to you. If you have children, for example, you have an obligation to know about what's going on in the realm of schooling, so you can properly choose how to educate your children. You also need to know about changes in the law that affect education. You need to know about health crises that your children might be impacted by. Of course, that goes beyond parenting, you also need to know about those things if you have a frail elderly person in your life, or an ailing cousin, or a sibling who cannot take care of themselves, and even for yourself.

If you work, you need to know about changes in the economy that may impact your job, or political issues to the extent that they could impact the economy.  If you pay taxes , you have an obligation to know about legislation that impacts taxes. If you're a homeowner, you need to know about housing and mortgage issues, and developments related to home maintenance. If you are a tenant, you need to know about rent issues, and if you live in subsidized housing, the happenings in the housing industry also. If you're a professional, you need to know about developments in your field to learn new information in order to improve upon your ability to operate  within it.

I think it's fair to say that engaging with current events can definitely impact your life and the lives of those around you in meaningful way. I can think of many examples from my own life, for instance it's been raining unseasonable amounts here of late, and I prevented cycling into a flood by watching the weather news yesterday.

---

In my opinion, we are being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. I think we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. If you are a U.S. citizen, you have even more responsibility because we live in such a powerful country and the things our nation does have a huge impact on other countries and all the people in the world. 

Even if you aren't a U.S. citizen, I think it is important to at least know what's going on in the world and understand the connections of your actions to the rest of the world. By being informed, you can make better decisions and be a purposeful part of your community and the world. 

Especially in the age of social media, it is so easy to become informed just by following your favorite news sites on Facebook or watching/listening to one of the many news sources on YouTube or any number of other places. It's become so easy that it can't be a viable excuse anymore. Not paying attention to news just means you are being lazy. 

I also think that events from last year and this year have made it even more important to stay informed. No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on.  If you don't stay up to date with politics, you're condemning your children's future by your apathy. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening.

Just by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know. You will be able to ask questions and look for answers. You will be a much more active and engaged citizen in your city, your state, and the nation.  You'll become a better person.  

I feel very strongly about being informed, and I care about what's going on in the world. I think it's a shame that so many people are not informed, and I'd like to change that. I hope I can make people more informed by asking them how they feel about/ if they know what is going on in the world. 

You don't have to like what you learn, but you can accept that it is happening and informedly fill in the blanks. I don't like what I saw on the news today, but I try to find new information to understand it and be a better citizen because of it. Engaging with current events may not seem like it has any effect, but through small changes, we're able to eventually, together, make the world a better place! Do your part, and don't choose apathy or blindness!

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

In my opinion, not at all. We all live on the same planet and no matter how much we try to remove ourselves from nature, we are still part of it along with all the animals and other living beings. If our animals are looked well taken care of, humans will benefit from it as well. Both with  healthy meats and strong, healthy bonds between pets. Also, when wild animals are better preserved, they are less likely to get diseased and there would be less of a chance of those diseases making their way into the human population. Of course, this is not always possible. There will be viruses that come from nature no matter how good we treat it but there will be less. 
I also think how we treat our animals and their habitats are a reflection of us as a whole. If we destroy them without much thought then we are more likely to destroy ourselves. The world is a relatively small place. We all share it, the more we protect it the more we protect ourselves. The healthier nature is the healthier we are since are all part of nature. 
So, in conclusion, no,  don notthink it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. since our suffering is all related in one way or another. ",20,7,10,0,3,9,3,6,1,2,0.0,0.5,0.15,0.5319148936170213

Anyone who has had the opportunity to love an animal knows that the love they felt is not different from the love they feel toward humans. Love is  transformative, redemptive and the ultimate source of all morality. Studies purporting to be shocked that a human would save a beloved animal before an unknown human miss the fact that there is not distinction between love for different sentient beings.

After all, there was a time when people would be shocked if one cared for a slave as much as for a ""free"" person. But we have learned that love is not limited by species any more than it is limited by any other prejudice.

Personally, I cannot conceive of anyone who spends time with animals not loving them. Such people do exist, but so do sociopaths. The difference is that sociopaths are not capable of love, while people who do not love animals are simply incapable of seeing the world through their eyes. This is more a failure of empathy than of psychology, but it is a failure nonetheless.

Throughout the world, laws are being passed to protect animals, which are being increasingly seen as rights-bearing entities. This is a good thing, as it will lead to the protection of animals from cruelty. But it is not enough. More laws need to be passed to protect animals from violence and murder.
TUltimately, te most important thing we can do to protect animals is to love them.

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is academic knowledge as well as social skills. Academic knowledge is important because it helps students to learn how to solve problems and think critically. This will help students cope with their future jobs and daily problems they encounter. Academic knowledge learnt at school is fundamental to everything. The knowledge will also help students distinguish between what is true and what is untrue, which is very important when the students make certain decisions on their own. Besides, getting along with their classmates at school also helps the students develop social skills, which are necessary for their survival in the society. he most important thing I have learned in school is the importance of being honest.
 I think honesty is the most crucial personality that one should possess. To conclude, the most important things students should learn in school is academic knowledge as well as social skills.

Dads all over the world were shocked. How did it happen? Some blame the economy, others say it's because of a gender bias. Some even blamed voodoo witch doctors, where ever the finger could be pointed.

Some dad mugs still said #1 though. Scientist started looking into the reason behind it. The reason the Dad mugs no longer said #1 was found out., kind of. At least the reasons behind it was clear even if no one understood how it happened. 

You see, what they found out was that the mugs really started to show how good of a dad a man was to his kids. The mugs were a window into the dad's soul. If he did not care about his children, then his mug would give a really low rating like #384657, or something like that.
If a dad really cared about his children a lot then the mug would say a really high number like dad #3 or 9 or even 7. 
Now, there were some dads who did nave a #1 mug., but those mugs where really only for the best of the best dads in the world. The one who did anything for their child. Taught them, guided them, never missed a softball game, and even took the team out for pizza after the game. 
The #1 Dad Mug was for the dad who would never let his kids down.
 The dad who really, and truly loved and would gladly sacrifice for his kids. Some dads got jealous, but to a good effect because they tried harder to be good dads, and not just fathers.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go.  I love to read, don't get me wrong.  But reading is way more limited than listening to an audiobook.  I can listen to a book while I am walking, driving, or doing the dishes.  I can't imagine some of the long driving trips I've taken by myself without an audiobook to listen to.  They've kept me alert and safe on those drives.  I can hear a story anytime that I don't have to be listening or concentrating on something else.  When I am taking long walks outside or on a treadmill, time passes more quickly when I have an audiobook playing. And audiobooks are great for my eyes.  My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and when I read for long periods I suffer from eyestrain.  

Audiobooks are also great for kids with learning disabilities, or that can't concentrate.  It also allows children in general to hear stories that they may not have been able to read because their reading isn't advanced enough yet.  Although we need to take care that children learn to read the words they hear at the appropriate time in their learning cycle.  Use of different voices are more engaging for a child as well, and they can still use their imaginations as they think about what the characters and their actions look like.

Another benefit of audiobooks is environmental.  They don't require use of paper or other materials, particularly when downloaded.  You can access them quickly and easily as well.

aving said all that, I still love to read.

Matt Damon is not only a national treasure, but he is well regarded in nations all around the world. Because of this, the nations will band together to free him from the evil clutches of the alien emperor. 

The United Nations put together a task force of some of the world's best agents. Each of them will be a specialist on one aspect of the operation. Failure in this mission is not an option. The crew underwent some rigorous training exercises to prepare them for blasting off into space. They also had to undergo a lot of physical fitness and weapons training. Since this was a secret mission, they got to use some top secret weaponry the general public does not know about. 
These agents will need to battle space pirates, smugglers, and of course the alien emperor., so the best weapons were needed for the journey. 

The day of the mission finally came. The agents went to the spaceport in England and boarded their rocketship. The rocketship took off to space and blasted toward their destination. It was going to be a quick flight since the intel received by the UN says that the aliens are not too far away from the moon at this point. 

Once the rocket breached the atmosphere, the shuttle broke off of it and the pilot took over the controls. The navigator used some intel and radar to scan the space and pinpointed the alien spacecraft. The navigator gave the directions to the pilot and he drove the shuttle off in that direction. 
The alien spacecraft was not too far away, but as the crew got closer they noticed something odd.
 There was a fleet of smaller ships following the alien ship closely behind. They were space pirates! Surely they had the same idea and wanted to capture Matt Damon for themselves. 
The UN task force needed to act fast.
 They sent two gunners to some turrets the shuttle was equipped with and they began blasting away at the space pirate ships. One by one, they exploded. Before the pirates could even react or retaliate, they were all defeated. 
The space shuttle went for the alien spacecraft and pursued it to prevent any other space pirates from taking Matt Damon.
 They were hot on their tail when a radio transmission came in from the alien emperor. The emperor said that they were taking Matt to their home planet to star in some movies made by them, so they can have their own entertainment. The UN space shuttle was not going to accept this. the commander of the mission warned the aliens to surrender Matt Damon or else they were going to blow up their ship and their planet. The emperor looked worried. He decided to try to cut a deal with the agents. 

The emperor tried to negotiate giving them another actor for their movies and they will return Matt Damon unharmed. They even offered a better actor, Will Smith. The agents would not give up Will Smith and counter offered with Nicholas Cage. The emperor looked upset as he considered this trade off. He told the agents that they will hold out for Nicholas Cage, but if he does not come with them then Matt Damon would never see Earth again. The agents agreed and called the UN to ship up Nicholas Cage for the trade.

A few hours later, a ship pulled up to the alien spacecraft and Nicholas Cage boarded it. Out came Matt Damon. The ship then flew away back to Earth.

I looked all around. All i see is me. Not like I am looking the mirror or looking at my reflection in the water, but literally a bunch of me. It was a little wierd since it was a bunch of naked me's, however still very interesting. All of the different people who looked identical to me were people who reincarnated as me. It was funny becuase all though we all looked similar, we had different intricate changes from the time period we were living in. For example, the reincarnation of me that fought in WWI was missing an arm from the war, and the me that lived in the 50's actually died around the age of 25 in a car crash.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid over and above their scholarships. They should be paid a percentage of ticket sales. I do not agree that the broader community would be harmed. This is real life. Times change. It is fair that if the college makes a great sum of income, some of it goes to the players. Colleges in bidding wars? They do that anyway, but without money. They bid for the best. The athletes would receive no compensation until they graduate, again, which would be a percentage of tickets sold. 

If colleges did not profit on their athletes, then no, they should not be paid. I think this is the best solution of all. This way, anyone can go to a game that they might not have otherwise been able to afford, creating good will in the community. Having good sports is a boon to the colleges. They get televised or broadcasted which increases brand awareness. There are some things that are hard to measure, like how much exposure they get and what it is worth.

The old power that reawakens does so in little spurts and it is hardly enough to overcome the hostile aliens. However, these spurts are enough to cause all sorts of things to change-including the abilities of those who possess it. This means that the people who have Mana suddenly feel an onset of odd physical and mental symptoms, including loss of memory, hallucinations, and strange abilities. 

In their weakened state, people who have Mana are of no use against the hostile aliens. As a result, the survivors who possess Mana are sent out into space to be what they call ""Watchers"" of the Earth. Their sole job is to radio back to Earth when they sense a threat to the people on Earth, regardless of whether that threat is coming from within the Earth's galaxy or outside of it. Meanwhile, all the other humans are left on Earth to try to fend for themselves. Their attempts are at first futile, because their counterattacks are so few and so disorganized, but the humans soon discover that they possess other strengths.

Upon receiving the radio signal directing them to return to Earth, the Watchers promptly forget it. And later, when the radio signal comes through with the same instruction again, the Watchers of the Earth end up hallucinating that the radio signal was falsely sent. So as a result, the Watchers spend an additional year watching over the Earth even though they are not actually doing anything productive with their time as there are no threats remaining against the humans on Earth. When the Watchers finally return back to Earth, they are greeted with less fanfare than they would have expected. They realize that the attacks from the aliens ended a year ago and feel dumb for having failed to heed the first radio signal.

In my opinion,  I think that it is important to focus on both because it is crucial to help everyone.

I think that it is wrong to focus on one and not the other because we are all living things and we all deserve to be treated equally. Both animals and humans have feelings and they both need help when they have sufferings. Priority should be given to the one with the worst suffering. In doing so, there will be more love in our society and no bias or prejudice, which is very important in creating a harmonious environment.  Remember that animals are humans' friends too. They are small and so they need protection from humans. And sometimes, humans are weak and they also need empathy from other people.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it really is up to the person to decide if it is too risky or not. As long as you are not putting anyone else in danger then it's a personal choice. Things like rock climbing without any type of safety harness are very dangerous. One slip and the person could die. However, they accept that risk and are okay with it. You don't have to agree with them, but they are old enough to make that call and if they feel it's the right choice for them then you can't judge them for it. 

The only time it may be considered selfish would be if the person had a family. If they are just doing it for fun and have a wife and children at home, then the risk may be selfish. If they however are a professional race car driver or stunt man then they are doing it to pay the bills. So even with a family there's an argument on both sides as to if it is indeed selfish. Each situation would be unique to that person.

Calling a risky sport a recognized sport is an entirely different story. It's something dangerous that we consider acceptable. Once upon a time there were gladiators and that was normal. We have these modern dangerous sports that we as a society now consider normal. However, sometimes we do take it too far. That is just what we consider acceptable though in general as a society right now. It may change throughout time and people may look at our current sports differently in the future and say no one should play that. For example, concussions in sports like football may one day be looked at differently. It could one day be banned. So we can pretend that sports like race car driving and extreme mountain climbing are normal, but they are really just what we consider acceptable now.

As far as if the risk overall is selfish or not has so many factors. I do not believe it is selfish. I know many people would disagree with me when they hear about someone accidentally dying while trying to do a stunt. However, the people who are doing those stunts are aware of the risks and possible outcomes. That's a risk they are willing to make and I accept their choice. If they are okay with it then I can not consider it to be selfish. ",31,5,20,0,6,6,6,0,1,5,0.0,0.6451612903225806,0.1935483870967742,0.4620123203285421

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. Like any other worker, they are selling their bodies and selling a service; for that, they should be adequately compensated.

College athletes provide a service to their schools; they attract fans and prospective students, they generate revenue, and they make schools known, often on a national level. They are the face of their schools, and they are the ones who put in the time and effort to make their schools successful. This is also in addition to juggling courseloads, jobs, and other student activities. Any other student working for the university would get paid, up to and including the mascot, so why not the actual athletes themselves?
The NCAA is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is not paying its workers.
 It's unfair to claim that paying athletes would cause financial issues for universities when those athletes bring in so much money in the first place. Raising ticket prices to sporting events would be one way to make up for the money that would be paid to athletes, for example. Another would be to pay athletes a standard wage much in the same way that other student staff are compensated; this would eliminate any risk of big universities buying star players.

Star collegiate athletes often go on to become professional players. If they will be paid for being in the big leagues, why not also pay them for the work that they do at a lower level? The NCAA is a stepping stone for these athletes, and it is unfair to them to not compensate them for their performance and efforts.

Even in athletics, the principles of workers' rights still apply. College athletes are not just students; they are entertainers, professionals, public figures, and ultimately workers. Their lives revolve around being in top physique so they can play for their universities the same way that major league players would. For this reason, they should absolutely be compensated and held in the same regard as anybody else who performs services of value.",25,9,10,0,6,11,6,5,2,4,0.0,0.4,0.24,0.49498997995991983

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. This power gives them the ability to have a collective mind. This new collective mind, called the Consciousness, is a remarkable phenomenon. But it is also a weapon that can give humanity the edge it needs to drive back the Ethereal invaders. It allows them to plan across the world without even having to communicate. They begin working on a plan. Using the Consciousness as a weapon, they begin to fight back against those who would see them destroyed.

They come up with a timed attack. They strike at the same times in every location and hit the Ethereals where they least expect it. This is successful. It catches them off guard. But it does not finish them off. They then have to focus their attacks more. People have to travel to join larger groups to take down the largest of the aliens. They have to work together to survive. They need to work together to end this.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?
There are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment.
 But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? 

Also, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.
The people who do a sport is also important.
 They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport. A good athlete is a responsible, safe, and upstanding member of the community. Sportsmen are not arrogant, and do not use violence. They should have a positive influence on their fans, and not encourage or promote risky behavior.",28,5,9,1,13,20,17,3,0,17,0.03571428571428571,0.32142857142857145,0.5,0.5128865979381443

In my opinion, extreme sports are too risky for the average person. There should be a bar to entry, such as having a certification in that sport. People should have adequate training so they aren't risking their lives, and people who do attempt the sport will at least have safety training and have to sign waivers that the understand the risks.

Snowboarding, for example, can cause injury easily and many people attempt it who are not very athletic and might not know what they're getting into. I think that the risks of snowboarding are too high for the average person, and it should be reserved for people who are trained in it. Training courses could be established and taught, and would not have to be rigorous, but it would be important for novice snowboarders to understand what they're getting into before they're just allowed out onto dangerous steep terrain. Ski lodges would have to offer trainers and documentation that people pass their courses before they are let out on the hills. There would need to be more rigorous training the more dangerous the snowboarding runs. For example, there might be a short, couple hour course for the beginner or novice hills, but a several day training and testing for the dangerous and steep runs.
I think that extreme sports should be reserved for people who are trained in them, and that there should be a bar to entry.
 That way, everyone involved would be safer. If a novice was out on a course and got in the way of an experienced snowboarder, he could cause a serious accident that the experienced snowboarder couldn't stop, no mater how expert he is. A novice is not only a danger to himself, but to all the other snowboarders around him. Making novices take lessons and barring them from snowboarding, especially around others, is only right and is best for their own safety as well as the safety of everyone else. Anyone who isn't willing to take some basic training is probably to arrogant to go out on dangerous hills alone anyway, they are more likely to injure themselves that more cautious snowboarders. 

In general, safety training is best for everyone, but especially for people who don't know what they are doing. Especially in sports that can cause serious injury or death if not done correctly.",21,5,14,0,2,8,2,6,1,1,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.09523809523809523,0.451271186440678

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

In my opinion, the answer to all of these questions is a sturdy “No”. Menstruation is an important life change, but it is best addressed by the parents. It is hard for me to imagine a parent of a young girl who had not taught their child about menstruation. That would be a clear dereliction.

In an ideal world, every young woman would have at least one good parent or guardian who teaches her about menstruation. But not every girl has at least one good parent or guardian. So in cases where a teacher judges that a student has been surprised by her first period, there should by a mechanism in place to offer that student immediate professional help, from a nurse or social worker, outside of the classroom. The topic could then be discussed honestly with the student in a comfortable atmosphere, only having to deal with girls who have been surprised by their first period. That should only be necessary in a small number of cases. If such a mechanism were in place, I’d be all for schools providing free pads and tampons, but not publicly.
I don’t think that it is appropriate to educate girls about menstruation in a group setting., because that is not a role met best by the schools. 

Schools should be responsible for what goes in young girls' brains, not their vaginas. The value and importance of education should not tied to our ability to arm our young people with facts--not tampons.

Schools should take a more active role in reducing and stopping the incidence of period shaming and period poverty. Schools are places that ought to be a place of comfort for its students, and should take more initiative to ensure the comfort and general well-being of its students - especially around issues that can be an awkward point of discussion for the students. Providing hygienic items, such as pads and tampons are critical to ensuring that goal, as by not doing so, they allow its female students to potentially experience negative outcomes such as bullying and or shaming due to their periods and their inability to acquire the items to remedy its symptoms. 

While I have not personally experience period shaming or similar forms of ostracize, other women have expressed their experiences with me. Their experiences have been very impactful to my thoughts and perspectives, and I empathize with the pain and discomfort they have gone through in school. The idea that anyone should be treated as than equal to others in school due to something out of their control is just illogical, and should definitely be stopped. Schools can do so regarding periods simply by providing free pads and tampons to students, just like it does with toilet paper, soap, and other hygienic items. These items should not be viewed as costs to the schools, but rather investments in ensuring the health and well-being of its students, who often have a hard time just talking about bodily functions due to societal taboos. Ensuring the health and well-being of its students will be of great benefit to their education, as, without both, one can not function optimally nor focus on their studies and learning.

Pads and tampons are quite similar to other hygienic items, especially bandages and plasters offered by the school. They both involve the stoppage of bleeding, and prevent people from staining their clothes, which is a positive outcome for them. The key thing to note is that pads and tampons still have a social stigma associated with them, thus greater care must be taken in their distribution. For example, schools should make sure that pads and tampons are distributed in areas where they are not visibly seen by students, who may ridicule them afterwards for asking for such items. Privacy must be maintained for the female students, as it ensures their comfort and ease in asking for said items. Furthermore, schools should ensure that the female students’ access to such items are as easy as possible, as those with periods may already suffer from pain and would not want to go through difficult means to acquire them. Pads and tampons ought to be available in schools freely for students that require them, as they are beneficial to their comfort and education, but care must be taken to ensure that their distribution does not cause further ridicule or shaming from the other students.",22,7,8,0,7,7,7,0,2,5,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.3181818181818182,0.44505494505494503

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. In fact, I think it is the right thing to do.   think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people because animals are innocent.; they do not have the ability to make choices, and they are not responsible for their actions. Humans, on the other hand, are responsible for their actions and have the ability to make choices.  So, an animal that is suffering cannot be responsible for its suffering, while a human who is suffering often is.
IThisibeing the case, t is tight thing tdo focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because we have a moral obligation to help those
 who are innocent and cannot help themselves.  Humans are often responsible for their own suffering, and they have the ability to help themselves, or should. By focusing on animal welfare over that of humans, we are merely living up to a basic moral principle.  In fact, if we were to focus on the well-being of humans instead in this situation, we would be doing something wrong.

Besides, just because a person places the welfare of animals over that of humans, it does not mean that they do not care about humans. I'm pretty sure that the people who expend effort and money towards furthering animal welfare are the same people who would spend time and money helping humans. I'm also sure that the people who raise this issue, and insist that animals are less important that humans, are the same people who would not help humans in need. The whole question is a false dichotomy. Helping animals is important, and moral, and so is helping humans. People will get the help that they need; they'll just have to wait their turn.",23,7,4,0,12,31,15,16,3,12,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.5217391304347826,0.4028776978417266

Rather, she claimed to others to be a witch, with terribly powerful spells and incantations, in a world where magic doesn't exist. For the most part, many didn't believe her and found her to be too weird to hang out with. It worked fine for Emily, who was an introverted girl who kept to herself, often spending her free time alone with a good book. That is, until she stumbled onto a mysterious book hidden in her friend's bookstore one day.
She had come to the bookstore one night after work anfter leaving her house key, ad fended up oindinga hidden section of books that could be found only if you knew the exact location
. She was mystified, she had been around the book store countless times, and even her friend did not tell her of this section. She believed it was just an ordinary book section, with other types of reading material. Looking through the books, she found they had intricate designs on their book spines and cover, but lacked any titles. Confused, she picked up a few. Opening each one showed the same outcome, the books were all blank. Every book in the section had no words written in them, except one that she found that looked out of place.
She picked up a book with a rather simple design on its cover, with a blue background and three circles orbiting around the center circle.
 Unlike the other books in the section, the book was titled, being called, ""Mana Invictum"". Being interested in the title, Emily opened the book and found it had text in it. More than that, it had writing in English, and wasn't just gibberish. The book was a magic book, that taught the user how to tap into Mana and wield magic. She was giddy with excitement, she would finally learn how to use spells like a witch.
She took the book home with her, and studied it for days.
 The book was complex on some parts, especially with some spells the book claimed was too dangerous to wield. Emily opted to learn a much more simpler spell to use, a spell that could illuminate her surroundings. Learning the correct ingredients to brew the spell's potion, she then drank it eagerly. It tasted terrible, but she powered through it and finished the potion. She felt an odd power surging inside her, and she realized it was her body absorbing the Mana around her. She then spoke the spells incantation, ""Illuminatium"" and watched in amazement as light filled her dark room. She had learned and cast her first spell. She felt more motivated to continue reading the rest of the book, and hopefully being able to wield more types of magical spells.
As she continued to read the book, she learned more and more spells.
 She learned basic spells such as creating a ball of light, laying down a few yards of flames around her, creating water from the air and blowing things away with a gust of wind. She was quite proficient, truly capable to be called a witch. Yet, she kept the book and her new powers a secret from everyone else. She realized the danger that could occur should others learn the magic within, much less if someone decided to use the most dangerous spells the book claimed to teach. She decided to stay at home practicing her craft, while keeping up with her normal life. The book would remain in her possession indefinitely, believing it was fate that caused her to find it in the first place. However, she also made a new goal in her life once she was done mastering all the safe spells in the book. he wanted to find out who wrote the book and why it was hidden away.
 Emily also wanted to know if other spell books existed in the world.

What the little pig didn't know is that the wolf was good friends with a scientist. He went to the scientist and asked the scientist if he knew what could destroy the material uranium.

The scientist told the wolf that the only thing that could destroy the home was fire. The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.

One day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity. He could light the home on fire and destroy the 92nd little pigs home.

One day, she’s on a date with a new guy, and she’s certain she’s finally found the one. They go on an amazing first date with a visit to a museum followed by a walk on the beach boardroom that's close by in which the man kissed her while they were both sitting on some big rocks at the end of the boardwalk trail. They ended up going home together and spent the night at her apartment, became intimate and ended up having many more dates after that. Not too long after, they ended up becoming exclusive. 
The woman then moved in with the man, and they lived together for a few months.
 Everything was going well but she noticed something strange about his face. At night when they were sleeping, it seemed to be a little different. It still looked mostly like him but not totally and it seemed to be physically different somehow. She even woke up once in the middle of the night and looked at him with just the night light on which cast barely any light and could've sworn that she saw him with a totally different face.

She screams in fear and yells, ""Who are you? Why are you here? What did you do with my boyfriend?"". The boyfriend replies, ""Whoa, calm down! I can explain everything!"". She replies, ""Get out of here and tell me how you got here!"". He then says, ""Look, I have to tell you something! You're gonna freak out but I have to tell you the truth.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

It is not unusual that studies have found that people are more empatetic or likely to help animals that are suffering, versus the suffering of fellow humans. Onereason is that animals are not able to speak for themselves, and they ceasily fight back or resolve what issue is primarily causing their suffering. Humans are considered to be more capable of handling their suffering or any issues that are affecting them, and can effectively voice their issues to others to ask for help. Thus, it is not wrong for people to be more empathetic towards animal welfare than human welfare. 

However, it is key to note that issues that affect animals are often intertwined with issues that affect humans and their welfare. Take for example climate change , which is a major issue that affects the welfare of both humans and animals. Climate change and its consequences notably will change the environments around the world, causing many animals to become endangered and suffer notably. In addition, humans will also suffer from such changes, and also the increase in frequency and severity of natural disasters. Humans have the capacity as a collective to resolve such issues, I do not believe they should ignore the suffering of animals when they are capable of helping them alongside the suffering of other human beings. 

For many, individually they may not be able to improve the welfare of animals or humans in a substantial or notable manner. However, collectively as a society, they can make a difference. It is important for many to become aware of a variety of issues that affect those that live in the world, and to spread the word to others. Through social media and other forms of communication, many can spread awareness of the issues that affect animals and humans alike, and encourage others to help resolve such issues. Even if people focus primarily on one over the other, such as animal rights, as long as they can spread word of initiatives they come across that also affects humans, I think they can make a difference. It is not that they lack empathy towards humans when they assist animal welfare issues, but rather that they choose to make choices that they feel make a more impactful choice. In the end, people will be able to resolve all issues in due time if they work cohesively. ",22,7,10,0,5,7,5,2,1,4,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.22727272727272727,0.4228456913827655

That is until 100 years ago, the source of all magic in the world mysteriously vanished. The world was plunged into an age of darkness, an age without Mana. Today, humans have been able to adapt to the harsh world without relying on magic, using instead alternative fuel sources to power the cities of the world. However, there are some who would seek to restore the lost source of magic, and have spent their lives scouring the planet for any information on how to do so. They have all been unsuccessful, producing nothing that would tell them where Mana came from, or how to potentially create more of it. That is, until a person accidentally stumbled upon a mysterious tome. 
The person who discovered  his tome was a young man named Isaac.
 He cared little about the greater world around him, focusing mostly on his work, his career, and those closest to him. He had heard much tales of magic from others who were informed of its history, but it didn't interest him. Magic no longer exists in the world, so why bother he would say. Despite that, the tome found itself in the attic of Isaac's home. He was certainly sure it wasn't his nor his family, so perhaps it was left by a previous owner of the house. Isaac and his curiosity led him to open the book, and found it was written in a mysterious language. He had no idea what it said, but found he was able to read the words by means he could not comprehend, and found that the book was about magic. It detailed the energy source, Mana, and told the reader how to use it to wield Magic. Isaac was astonished, but ultimately skeptical of the tome. He believed it to be a hoax, and left the book in the attic as he then went off to bed.

Upon waking up, he had been startled to see the tome had appeared at the foot of his bed, open to a particular page. Isaac, still skeptical of the book, had a feeling that it was important page to read, so he stood up from the bed to read it more carefully. The page told information on how to create Mana, which shocked Isaac. He was still unsure, but decided to try it out. Sure enough, Mana was created and he wielded a crude form of magic. Mystified, he then thought what to do with the book. He decided to keep it a secret, and not tell anyone. Perhaps it was best that magic was forgotten in the past. Given the state of the world, what may happen, he thought if people learned magic. Isaac placed the tome in a chest he owned, and locked it for good. Although it would appear to him every now and then, he decided to keep his promise, and keep it out of the eyes of others. Magic for the time being, would still be dormant. Perhaps, Isaac thought, the next person that came across the tome would share it with the world, and Mana would once again be created to let humans wield magic once more.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

What is a sport? Is it a personal quest for achievement?

Hardly.

A sport is a business, and its purpose is to make money, pure and simple. A sport gets played because it makes money for the owners and players. Nowhere in the calculation of profit does it consider the risk to the participants. As long as the public will buy tickets, watch on TV, buy sports apparel, cheer them on as heroes and call their names from the stands, anything goes. he owners do not care whether their employees are alive or dead, so long as they make money.


The idea that society owes a duty of protection to athletes who are budding millionaires, and choose their sport voluntarily, is quaint. Although some may expect them to avoid activities that may result in their premature death, it is not our duty. Capitalism is amoral, money talks, and ethics fall by the wayside.
When we see a wealthy 23-year -ld pextreme slorts payer being carried on an air stretcher after rupturing a disk in his back,
 we shrug and wait for the next match. If the player is cured, you can bet they will be right back in the arena. And if he is forced into retirement, then just wait for the movie and book deals.

rensome sports too dangerous to play?
 By what standards could this be even determined? The players are earning a living, and they may be willing to risk their lives, for better or worse. And the point of sports is to push limits and boundaries. 

Without risk, there is no sport. As long as there is a demand for high-risk athletes, there will be someone willing to take the chances. And that demand shows no sign of abating. So long as profits exceed the risks, the high-risk sports will persist.

He explains that he is trying to start an underground project that will help prevent people like Donald Trump from ever getting elected again.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

The people who started to discover this long lost power of how to use mana were called Magicians. It was up to them to try to stop the hostile aliens from completely annihilating the human race. They had their work cut out for them to say the least. 

What is mana you ask? Well, it is the life force that flows through everything. Some people call it the soul of the world, ever renewing. None the less, the magicians had a plan to get rid of the aliens for good. They would use the power of mana to summon a giant dragon to destroy the aliens. It was a spell they found in a book that was written thousands of years ago, and yet preserved for this very moment. The old magicians knew this day was coming. They knew that the time of the dragons was coming again, to save all humans from an alien invasion.

All the magicians of today had to come together in one area to cast the spell. So they did. It worked like a charm, and not just one dragon came from it, but thousands. They flew all around the planet wiping out the aliens on the ground. They didn't really have any trouble with that either, because the aliens did not ever expect it, and did not know how to deal with it. The aliens were used to fighting humans, not dragons.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. 

There is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.

It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. 

The smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. 

The smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. he smell is here.
 
You drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.

""Vanity"" the man says. ""Vanity and narcissism are rotting people at their core, rotting their life away from the inside out""
You fall forward, still retching as the man approaches you.


""But, I've lived a good life, why am I the one to suffer and have to stay locked up inside to avoid the rot?"" you ask

""You're not the one suffering"" he says. ""We all are.""

At this point you realize that you can't live this way. You are dying a regular death. A death that was once natural. The others? They are dying unnaturally and their vanity makes it so that they will never even know. You turn back towards the man and see a syringe on the bed beside him. You stand up and grab the man by his neck. ""Why are you making me do this?!"" you cry. 

""I'm not making you do anything, I'm just giving you the option now that you know the truth"" the man replies.
And so, you reach for a syringe and gather the last of your courage.
 It's this or never leaving home again, dying alone in pain without anyone knowing or dying now.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the increased screen time during the pandemic, is one of the least of our problems right now. Sure, too much time in front of a computer or TV can be bad for you, but the pandemic, as well as many of the other social and environmental changes we've experienced over the past year or so, are much more worthy of our attention. For example, increased screen time can lead to eye strain. Covid, on the other hand, can lead to a massive strain on the health care system, and vast loss of life. Spending too much time on social media can be wasteful and unproductive. The collapse of the government in Afghanistan, however, is a real threat to the stability of the region, will cause many deaths of both U.S. citizens and Afghans, and will have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. and the world, including a possible massive spike in terrorist.

Too much Netflix can lead to a lack of sleep. Having a U.S. President with senile dementia, by contrast, could lead to a collapsing economy, national and global instability, and other consequences up to an including a nuclear war. Typing on your phone too much, might lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Antifa and BLM protesters assaulting you in the streets, however, could lead to a broken nose, a concussion, or a fractured skull.  Talking to your co-workers exclusively on Zoom could cause you to miss out on the office gossip. Attempting to get to work in a collapsing, Covid-ridden, lawless city, however, could lead to a mugging, a carjacking, contracting Covid, or worse.

The past year has been a year of social and environmental changes that have been far more disruptive and hazardous to our lives than the screen time debate. Increased screen time is absolutely trivial by comparison to any of these things, and if someone can say that its the reason for the worst problems they're currently experiencing, I say that person has a lot to be thankful for.",20,6,3,1,10,21,14,7,0,14,0.05,0.15,0.55,0.5314009661835749

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students should learn primarily the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, in addition to a foundation of understanding in history, science, and the arts. These things have long been considered the basics of a good education, and I believe they should remain so. A student who can't read will have difficulty learning any other subject, inside of school, or out, and a student who can't write will have difficulty communicating with others. The fundamentals of math are necessary for students to do things like balance a checkbook,  figure out how much change they should get back from a cashier, budget household expenses as an adult, and do many other things that are necessary for everyday life. Eventually they'll need an understanding of math, as working adults, to not be reliant on accountants to do their taxes.

Students need to understand world history , as well as the history of their own country, in order to understand how the world came to be the way it is today. They need to understand the basics of science in order to understand how the world works, and how to use that knowledge to their advantage, such as by understanding how to use a computer, or how to fix a car. Some knowledge of the arts is needed in order for students to appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and to be able to enjoy life.

Of course, there are many other things that students need to know. They need to know how to interact with others, how to be a good citizen, and how to be a good person. They need skills that will help them be successful in life, such as how to interact with others, how to be a good employee and how to take care of themselves. They need to learn job skills.

These things are not really the job of the public school system, though. They are the job of the parents, society at large, colleges, and vocational schools. The public schools try to do too much already. They should instead focus on the basics, and leave the rest to other institutions, and endeavor to provide children with a foundation upon which they can build their future. If schools are able to construct this basic foundation, other institutions will be able to build upon that foundation, and the students will be better off for it, as will society as a whole.",23,6,4,1,12,24,19,5,0,19,0.043478260869565216,0.17391304347826086,0.5652173913043478,0.421505376344086

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, human's put too much human emotion onto their animals or other similar animals. They anthropomorphize them and think they hurt and suffer the way humans do. I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because humans are more important. I could go into how God promotes this notion but that would end this debate in an instant and the atheist out there would dismiss it out of ignorance. I think people see their dogs and cats as part of the family when in reality they are just using us for food and shelter while we are the ones that give their actions purpose and most are geared towards us humans. Does a worm scream when you put a hook through it? No, it does not understand what it is feeling and does not understand the concept of death so its just an inconvenience until it is eaten by a fish in the natural cycle of things. Dogs came to be because we fed them when they came around and eventually the dogs realized it was in their best interest to co exist with man and they did not because they agreed upon it but because their instincts led them in that direction. They are not our equals and they will never be. It that simple. They do not feel as we feel, they do not suffer as we suffer and the circle of life has been going on since the creation of the earth. We kill and eat animals while other animals do the same to lesser creatures. Whether go or evolution is responsible for us being at the very top of the food chain is irrelevant, what counts is that we are there and it is our right to use animals in any way we see fit.

First, Matt was taken to a space ship, vaguely shaped like a saucer. On every screen inside it a different Episode of Jimmy Kimmel's show played, no matter which direction Matt Damon looked, he was forced to stare into the gaping Maw of that villainous creature. The horrific maw of none other than Kimmel. There seemed no escape, no escape in heaven, Space, Hell, the world, everywhere Matt Turned, Jimmy tormented him.
Finally, Matt Damon was brought to an isolated area of the planet, where he was asked to solve a puzzle.
 It was a jigsaw, the face on the puzzle? Guess? yeah you got it. Jimmy Kimmel. It depicted the face of the archenemy, poised in full ire, with gaping maw presented fully, giving a detailed view of every dental feature and facial pore of the immutable Kimmel. Damon was told he had 2 minutes to complete the puzzle or he'd have yet a more difficult task. The Kimmel looking alien held high, an hour glass, Cackling the Kimmel like alien said ready, set, and then he put the glass down and the sands began to gather with irritating velocity to the bottom of the glass - GO he said then disappeared with a poof.

Damon was taken to a series of rooms containing a variety of confusing puzzles and objects.
 He said, choose your station maggot. The Kimmel look alike again laughed, Cackling. Damon simply went to the nearest station, it had several Kimmel masks. The Kimmel Alien said, GOOD choice. Again laughing, turning around, he looked like, none other than Damon himself. It was like a mirror. So The alien Damon pointed to the mask, then to his face, saying DO IT. So, Damon put on the mask, where he morphed into Kimmel, so here the two sat, facing each other. One frowning, one smiling Maniacally.  The ship began to tumble downwards, to what must be Earth.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes schools should provide pads and tampons to school but only to those students that need them while they are at school. I think that schools should provide pads and tampons to students because it is a necessity just like toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other toiletries of the like. 

As I am a guy, I have not ever experienced period shaming or period poverty, nor have I ever done those kinds of things to a person ever. Schools should somewhat step in there because it mostly happens on their grounds, kind of making their responsibility to address such issues.
I think that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools
 anyways, because all are necessary when needed. If you get a nasty cut on your arm at school, they send you to the nurses office to help you cover the wound so you are not getting blood everywhere.  Toilet paper,  well obviously they must provide that. Just like soap, and the others, pads and tampons are needed sometimes for all students, not just the poor ones.

As far as period shaming, yes the school should step in the best it could and try to help those students that are being bullied. Try to make everyone understand that a period is something that every single girl in the world has to deal with, and that it is just part of evolution and growing up. That there is nothing that can be done to stop it, no matter how hard anyone tries.
Explain that no one wants to be bullied over natural, and perfectly normal body functions.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading one. There are many benefits to listening to a book in my opinion since it allows you the ability to multitask while you are doing other things. For example, you can go for a jog while listening to a book, drive a car, or even clean the house. I am personally a huge fan of listening to books because i love efficiency. Any time i am able to get a lot of stuff done i just feel better about myself in general. I also dont really ever have a calm mind if i feel like i have a ton of stuff to do for the day anyway, so being able to get things done while also entertaining my brain is paramount. In addition to all of this, i find that audiobooks even save you money in comparison to the physical copy of the book. Digital versions of books are so much cheaper since there is no cost to actually make the book.

While audiobooks have their benefits and happen to be my preference, i can understand the draw towards physical books as well. Being able to hold a book and read it right there is an immersive experience that some find hard to live without. It is completely quiet and all you hear are the sounds of the book in your mind. It is like meditating in a way, and this is what some people do to calm themselves. Reading is for the experience however, so whatever your preference is what you should go with. Whichever way allows you to most enjoy the book is the method that is best for you. Audiobooks simply allign with my lifestyle to a tee and is the obvious choice for me to get the most out of my day to day life while also enjoying a book. I dont think i would even shop for books if audiobooks were not available. I just have trouble finding the time in my day to day to read unless I want to take away some of the family time i get.  think that audiobooks are a great way to get the most out of your day., and i am extremely grateful that they even exist. I do like to pull out a book from time to time just for the traditional feel, but i do quickly find myself going back to the tried and true method of audiobook listening. I will cook the family meals while listening to books, work on my laptop while listening, and even shower sometimes with the audiobook on my speaker. It just fits with my life like a mold!

So in conclusion, i personally find listening to a book to be just as good as reading it without a doubt. I do see the other side and welcome every to enjoy books the way they please. I am glad that people have the freedom to choose, because everyone has different preferences when it comes to this.

You feel some anxiety about the wedding because though you love Matt, you have a very tangled history with your ex-husband, Tyler.

But you are desperate to get married to Matt, because you feel that he is the only person who can give you the life you want. After all, how many nice guys are there that will accept a divorced mother still in their twenties? 
On the day of your wedding, you are very nervous and you can't stop crying.
 You genuinely feel that you are roping Matt in for a life he doesn't want. You feel that you are forcing him to be a father to your daughter, and you feel that he will resent you for it. You feel that he will never love you like you want him to. And yet, at the same time, you are worried about how you will support yourself and your daughter if you don't marry Matt. After all, you have no other prospects, and you don't know how you will be able to pay for your daughter's private school tuition if you don't marry Matt now and lock him down. Plus, your job at St. Hilda's is not exactly secure, since you tend to be a bit of a flaky employee who starts drama in the workplace. 

So ultimately, you decide to go through with the wedding. The financial security is really too compelling , and you feel that you have no other choice. It's unfortunate though, because you know that Matt doesn't really love you, and you know that he will resent you for forcing him to be a father to your daughter.

You will be devastated, and you will feel that your whole world has been destroyed.

ITeaching these things in schools offers students a good foundation for the future. It teaches them how to choose and direction and how to get themselves there. This can be applied to many different areas of life. It will help student successfully complete their studies. It will help them to be successful in their career.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.  

Colleges with big sports programs would protest this mightily but then they need to refocus their sight on providing an excellent education for all their students. ",22,9,10,0,3,4,3,1,0,3,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.13636363636363635,0.5572139303482587

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screen time is an important benchmark in how we are spending our time. Whether or not there is inherent risk in what we do on our screens aside, spending too much time staring at a screen is physically unhealthy. t's not just the eyes that suffer, it's the body.
 Physical exercise is important for people to maintain energy. When we sit, lay or even stand in one position for too long, our bodies suffer the consequences. 
I'm not saying that we should all go out and run a marathon.
 What I'm saying is that we need to be mindful of how much time we spend in a stationary position. The pandemic has accelerated our submersion into a more digital world. That is unfortunate, but it didn't cause this particular problem but rather just shined a light on an already growing issue that people were facing, especially children and young people.  
The good news is that we can all take steps to mitigate the negative effects of screen time.
 Apps are available for all major platforms which can help us monitor our screen time. I use Moment on my iPhone and it's a great way to keep track of how much time I spend on my phone. With the information I'm provided, by the app, I am better able to manage my daily activities. For instance, I can restrict my phone usage to a certain number of minutes, or hours, before taking a break to exercise, rest or do something else. I find that when I'm keeping track of my time in a more detailed way, I am shocked by the amount of time I devote to staring at a screen.  also use a desktop app called Self Control to block certain websites for a set amount of time.


The pandemic is very difficult for everyone but if we can find any bright spots in the tragedy of this time period, I think we will find them in retrospect.

Do you think all people should have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? I do. I believe that people should be knowledgeable and informed about local and national issues at the very least. How can we as citizens form well-thought out opinions without knowledge and facts? To do what's best for ourselves, family, and country we have a responsibility and civic duty to stay up to date and informed about current events. 

If we do not fulfill our civic duty as citizens then our opinions and decisions will not be based on facts. if our opinions are not based on facts then this might led to conflict with others, especially when one doesn't have any logical reasons to say why they feel one way or another about a specific topic. If you are unable to explain why you think or feel like you do about a specific topic, how can you expect others to listen to what you have to say or respect your views? The answer is, they won't.

here are people who don't think it is their responsibility to keep up with news.
 They want to believe what they want to believe to be true or share the same views with someone that they like regardless of whether or not their views are based on facts or not. We are all guilty of this at some point in our lives.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, I totally do not think college level athletes should get paid. They are getting an education, which is payment enough. Let's face the facts here. While I agree these athletes are very talented, the majority of them will not be drafted by a pro level team. They will have to have a backup plan when they are done playing college sports. That's where their education will come in handy, for most at at least. 

I also agree with the article that if you paid these athletes, that really will create an air of an open market from the colleges to try to outbid each other for the athlete. Then they are not really worried about the students education, but more worried about how well the student can play. Often times the colleges will give passing grades to a failing athlete, just to keep them on the team. It even happens in high school where students are not paid. How would you like to hire a lawyer, doctor, or teacher and know they were not qualified enough, but the professional institution they learned from pushed them through?

Another thing I can see would arise from the issue is the colleges would pay the big name athletes sports such as basketball, or football, but the intellectual athletes, such as chess players or debate clubs would get nothing except maybe appreciation for their sport.  

So I think a scholarship is payment enough, as long as the student doesn't let their GPA fall and remembers why they are there in the first place.",21,9,9,0,3,5,3,2,1,2,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.14285714285714285,0.5613207547169812

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to be independent in school. I don't think that they should be taught everything, because they have to learn how to learn on their own. My favorite teacher in high school was my English teacher, Mrs. Hensley. She was a great teacher, and she taught me how to be independent. She did so by giving us a lot of freedom in our writing. And moreover, she gave us a lot of freedom and independence in choosing what we wanted to write about, and even what our assignments would be. I loved her class because she was so open to what we wanted to write about, and she was very encouraging. I really disliked my teachers who boxed me into a certain type of writing, and I didn't like it when they told me what to write about. I never felt like I got much out of their classes because they were so restrictive.

After all, now that I've graduated from school, I have to be independent. When my boss tells me to do something, I have to be able to do it on my own. I have to be able to think for myself, and I have to be able to take instructions and figure out a way to execute on them. Realistically speaking, I have to be able to do this in order to succeed in life. So it's a real shame that some teachers don't teach their students how to be independent. Some teachers are so restrictive that they don't let their students think for themselves.  For example, I had a teacher in high school who was so restrictive that she wouldn't let us use the word ""I"" in our writing. She said that we had to use the word ""one"" instead. Silly, right? That's a kind of rule that I think is ridiculous. If I'm turning on my thinking cap and getting my creative juices flowing, I don't want to be told that I can't use the word ""I."" It's just a dumb rule.

In general, I think that the independence that Mrs. Hensley taught me in high school has helped me a lot in my life. And in the future, I think that it will help me a lot, too. After all, I know that as I rise in the ranks, I'll need to be able to think for myself. Mrs. Hensley didn't let us slack off in class; she just let us choose the assignments we wanted to work on. For example, I could choose to write a paper on the Civil War, or I could choose to write a paper on the history of the automobile. Both of these assignments would require me to develop a thesis and a body of evidence to support my thesis. But I really felt like I had ownership over my work when I was given the freedom to choose what I wanted to write about. And I really felt that I could do my best work when I was given the freedom to choose what I wanted to write about.

So in general, I was very happy to have learned how to be independent in high school. I never really use calculus or trigonometry, so I can't say that the actual curriculum that we are taught in high school is as important as the independence that we learn. When was the last time you used a quadratic equation? I'm sure that you can't remember. But I'm sure that you can remember the time when you were given a project to do, and you had to figure out how to do it on your own. It probably last happened just a day or so ago. 

In conclusion, I think that the most important thing that students should learn in school is how to be independent. It's really a lifelong skill to have and for that reason students should take advantage of every opportunity they have to exercise their independence in their learning.",42,6,4,0,32,51,36,15,0,36,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.7619047619047619,0.32180851063829785

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is arrogant and asinine to call any sport too dangerous to be considered a sport. This is the same type of argument that can be used to deny someone the freedom to travel, because traveling can have criminal consequences. The only thing that makes any sport dangerous, is when it is performed in a reckless manner. 

One cannot simply call a sport, like mountain climbing, too dangerous to be considered a sport, without defining what is reckless about it. If one calls mountain climbing too dangerous then they are literally saying that it is reckless to climb a mountain. One cannot simply use the term reckless and make everyone agree on the same thing. We all have different standards. To assume that we all think the same is not only arrogant, but is also an injustice against us as a free country with the freedom to be different.

Calling a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport is asinine because the definition of sport has changed over the years.   People in the past considered sports to be things like bullfighting and gladiator fighting; things that many would consider reckless by today's standards.  Hunting, fishing, javelin-throwing and archery all involved substantial risk.  

Ask a person from the early 1900's what sports are and they would probably say boxing, horseback riding, or hiking and skiing.  Teddy Roosevelt engaged in the ""sport"" of big game hunting and one of his companions was killed by wildlife during one of his hunting ""safaris."" 

When one calls a sport too dangerous to be considered a sport, they are effectively ruling out many of man's favorite pursuits throughout time. Each person has their own definition of risk. To each their own. Just because someone thinks high-risk activities are reckless, does not necessarily mean everyone else feels the same way.  

The most important thing in determining the value of a sport, is how the participants evaluate it on their own terms. People evaluate something based on what they want out of life.

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is like looking at a painting without ever seeing it in person. You are technically experiencing it but you are missing out on the fine details that make it special. It's an experience, not just a story. his is not to say that audiobooks are inferior.
 They just are an alternate experience. They just lack the full experience that you otherwise could be having with a book. 
Have you ever listened to an audiobook?
 The process alone is different. You're not using your eyes. You're listening and hearing someone else read the story. You're not hearing it in your head. Instead, you're hearing someone else and their voice emphasizing key parts of the story. It just makes it different. The experience is still valid for sure. It's just different. 

I enjoy listening when I do not have free time to focus specifically to a book. This way I can listen to the story when doing something else. I feel like that's how most people listen, so they can multitask while listening. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that audiobooks are bad, I'm just giving insight as to how I look at them
. They are an alternate choice, not the primary choice for reading. It's good to keep in the back of your mind that there is more than one way to read. It's like having one in your holster just in case. Reading is overlooked so any form of it is better than not doing it at all. 
I would recommend listening to audiobooks if you're in a car or doing something else that requires your attention outside of just the book
. Maybe listen to one while taking a bath. If you have the time however, sit down and hold a book. Flip through the pages and enjoy the unique experience that is brings.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, engaging mindfully with our world is important and it's really hard to do that without keeping up with the news. I think it's necessary to know what is going on in the world because it helps us understand the context of our lives. People should keep up with the news and current events so that they can respond in the way that's necessary for society. It's also important to keep up with the news to that a person can be informed as a voter. With a population more informed, people can vote on the issues in a way that's more beneficial to everyone. 
Another reason I think it's important for folks to keep up with the news is because it's a way to stay connected to people. If you know more about current events, especially in your own community, it's much easier to start a conversation with a stranger. It also helps when another person wants to start a conversation with you, for you to have some idea of topics they may talk about. The world around us, in a way, is the thing that connects us, so this common knowledge is vital, especially in a democratic society.
I also thing that engaging with current events can help communities by addressing the needs of the less fortunate. Only by communicating with one another can people get involved with helping others in their area. 
The benefits of keeping up with the news are numerous. However, a population that is uninformed would be without these benefits. It is for this reason that I believe that it is necessary to keep up with the news, and yes, we are being bad citizens if we do not.

In my opinion, one of the most stereo typical characters that made me cringe was Steve Erkel. I think some of the cheap laughs that the writers and producers were going for fell flat and made him into a very annoying character that I literally groaned. They tried to portray him as the classic stereo typical nerd. With big glasses always falling off his face, suspenders, pocket protector, lanky, and socially awkward. It bothered me because it was terrible writing, bad comedy, and full on negative stereotypes. They tried to make it seem like anyone that was a ""nerd"" was socially inept, walking around looking stupid while being smart. The comedy was bad also.

Normally I would not mind stereo types in a TV show, as long as it is used in good taste unlike my example I just talked about. The use of stereo typical character types also makes me cringe especially when it is done without any awareness. Shows like the Big Bang Theory does it in taste without taking it to far. What I mean is that there are some shows where it is obvious they are stereotyping someone for the sake of cheap laughs, but no one in the real world is really like that for the most part.

I normally avoid shows and movies that play it's main characters like that, because I do not feel it is right. The people who are hurt by them are the ones that deal with it in real life.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be worried about screen time during the pandemic. 
The evidence is clear: Screens are bad for us.
 
We are already seeing the negative effects of screen time on our children.
 I know that my daughter Harper is glued to her iPad and she's only 7 years old, turning 8 soon next Valentine's Day. 
I am worried about the effects of screen time on her brain development.
 Of course, I'm usually too preoccupied with my own life to really monitor Harper's screen time to the T, but I do know that she's on her iPad for hours at a time. Sometimes she'll even fall asleep with it in her hands. When I ask her to put it down, she'll say, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Obviously I don't want her to be on her iPad for hours at a time, but I also don't want to be the kind of parent who is constantly telling my child what she can't do, since saying ""no"" all the time is just not a good parenting strategy. So far, I've been able to strike a balance between the two, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up. That's because during COVID, Harper's school went fully virtual, meaning that she's now spending all day on her iPad. I mean, some of that time is obviously spent on actual learning, but I'm sure that there's a lot of time spent on mindless entertainment as well.

The thing is, is that I know that Harper is not the only child who is spending hours on her iPad. I know that there are many other children who are spending more time on their iPads than they should be. But there is so much more to life and to childhood than just sitting on your iPad all day. When I was young, I spent a lot of time on my Game Boy, but I also played outside with my friends and I read books. Moreover, I was a very social child and I had a lot of friends. I loved meeting new people and I loved being around other kids. On weekends, I would go to the mall with my friends and we'd hang out in the food court. Now, I'm a little concerned because Harper is just glued to her iPad all day. She really enjoys watching movies, and her favorite right now is Moana. She also likes watching her favorite TV shows, which are mostly cartoons. Ultimately, if I let her, Harper could spend all day on her iPad. 

I don't want my seven year old daughter to be a social recluse. And I definitely don't want her to be a couch potato, since that could negatively effect her health. What happened to the days when kids played outside? Every time I suggest to Harper that she go outside and play, she says, ""But Mommy, I'm almost done."" Or sometimes I ask Harper if she wants to go to the park with me and she says, ""But Mommy, I'm watching a movie."" Frankly, this doesn't seem to bode well for her future social life. So I've decided I need to be much more vigilant about Harper's screen time.

That's not to say that I'm going to be a helicopter parent and constantly monitor Harper's screen time. After all, I recognize that screen time is a necessary part of life. And screen time is not all bad. For example,  I think that screen time can be a great educational tool. One game Harper really enjoys is called ""Math Bingo."" She's learning math while playing the game. And she's learning to read while playing ""Sesame Street."" But at the same time I just really don't want to go down a rabbit hole with Harper where she's just sitting on her iPad all day. Growing kids need to be active and they need to be social. So this is where I come out on this issue, and I'm sure that there are many other parents out there who feel the same way.

After hearing Bruce's pitch, the executives all agreed that his show sounded just like all of those other shows about families and relationships.
 He left the meeting wondering whether that was a good thing or not. They said they would talk it over with the programming director and get back to him. 
He went home that night and was a bit worried.
 That wasn't really a yes or no answer. He decided to google who their current programming director was; maybe he could research them and get an idea of what they liked. When he got his answer he was stunned. Carol Danvers. His ex-girlfriend from over a decade ago. Not only that she was the one who gave Bruce the idea in the first place. Or rather, she and he had written a pilot together, back when she was young and he was the one established in the industry. He didn't really have faith in the script back then though and had lied and told her he pitched it and it got rejected. That was actually the beginning of the end for their relationship. Carol was heartbroken, thinking she had wasted all of that time and effort. He thought she got out of the industry. He was apparently wrong.

Two weeks later he finally got a call back. He was invited to the ABC Studios for a pitch meeting with Carol and the executives. He wasn't sure if he should be excited or terrified. Did she remember him? Or the idea? He had re-written it quite a bit, but the core idea and themes were still the same.
When he arrived at the studios Carol was there, along with the other executives.
 Bruce almost made an excuse and fled. She looked severe, and extremely unemotional. He was suddenly terrified she was going to accuse him of plagiarism. 
Carol stared at him with her pale yellow eyes, and looked him over from head to toe.
 She gestured for him to sit down. This was it. His career was over. But then something unexpected happened. She just...turned off? The executives all laughed. They explained that several years ago they had replaced their human programming director with an android. They loved his show idea, and since his show even incorporated the idea of androids pretending to be humans he was the perfect person to tell. They just needed him to sign a few agreements first. 

""But where is the real Carol, does she know about this?"" Bruce asked. 

The executives all had unsettling grins, but didn't answer. One locked the door as another closed the blinds, and a third, brought out a stack of paperwork and a video camera. Carol's eyes lit up and she smiled, revealing rows of perfect white teeth. It was then that Bruce knew what was going on.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, citizens living in democratic country have the responsibility to keep themselves well informed so that they can be well-qualified to participate in their own government (i.e., vote). Without a basic knowledge of the events that shape political issues both at home and abroad, a citizen will be unable to participate in meaningful ways to vote in matters related to those issues, or even know where they stand on an issue. For instance, if you don't know what a bill is, how are you supposed to make an informed vote on it? If you aren't well informed about the latest developments in climate science, how can you responsibly make a decision when a politician campaigns on claims that that global warming does, or doesn't, exist? If you don't know where your country stands on the world stage, how can you intelligently weigh in on the validity of candidates' foreign policy claims?

In addition, living in our modern era, we are often privy to information that can be quite overwhelming, and misleading, and simply consuming what the mainstream media feeds us, is insufficient for a voter to consider themselves well-informed enough to participate in democracy. We have to look at different media outlets, news stories and fact-check them, in order to be well-informed. Otherwise, we risk being exposed to a distorted narrative that either intentionally, or inadvertently, creates misinformation and post-factual situations. This, unintentionally, or by design , shuts us out from the process of making informed votes about issues that can seriously affect us or the entire nation, or for that matter the whole world.

Today, we have the ability to harness all this information, through the internet and social media, and this can give birth to powerful democratic forces that can create real change in politics for the better. It is crucial that as citizens of a democratic country, we take this responsibility seriously and exert not only effort, but judgment, so that we can do this.",17,6,0,1,10,13,13,0,0,13,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.6470588235294118,0.5275

What kind of a trick was this, Americans thought. They were left to their own devices and decided to explore space instead. The technology they advanced in was nothing short of groundbreaking.
Still, they felt slighted because they didn't even start the war. They tried to stay out of it. The rest of the world should have done the same. None of this would have happened.

None the less, it was time to set aside the past, and figure out why the world forced them into isolation alone. Was it a fear of the Americans? Was it the rest of the world wanting to be the superpower? who knows.

Once Americans figured it out that they were alone in isolation, they decided to use their knowledge of space travel that no one else had quite mastered yet to just move all of America of the planet and settle on another planet. 
The first and primary planet they decided to move to was Mars.
 They knew how to make it a livable planet now. They started launching science and engineering ships up first to create an ionosphere to protect from the sun and space radiation. Soon after they started launching citizens there by the thousands. America was becoming an interstellar nation, no it had a planet all to itself now.

After around 50 more years, by some miracle of technology, Mars was green with foliage, and blue with oceans, rivers, and plenty of water. Americans lived out their time very comfortably on Mars without worrying about what was going on back on Earth anymore. Now they really were isolated, like everyone else wanted.

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky sports like extreme mountain climbing. People have the right to choose what they want to do with their lives. As long as they are not hurting anyone then it's their right to do as they choose. It could be viewed as selfish but its their body. 

Some people will say that if you have a family that you have to put them first. What if something happened to you? Who will provide for them? Who will take care of them? That brings us to another part of this debate. If you do have a family, is it more selfish if you do an extreme sport purely for fun? Or is it considered equally selfish as someone who does it as a profession? These are really important factors that drive this debate. There is no clear answer as its purely a matter of perspective. 

As far as if some sports are just too dangerous to be called a sport, that's something that is an issue all of its own. There are many sports that are dangerous but they are still considered a sport. Even a child playing football could end up with a head injury and many parents consider that an acceptable risk. I feel that as long as a sport is popular then public opinion tends to be that the risk is worth it. 

It shouldn't be considered selfish to do extreme sports. What we really should focus on is just ensuring that these sports are as safe as possible because people aren't going to stop doing them. That's honestly the best approach to the situation. Then if they are safer maybe we won't judge the people participating in them quite as much.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. At first, they don't believe that it's happening. But as the power grows, they realize that it's not a dream. An ancient capability has taken root in the human beings who once didn't even believe in magic, or the supernatural. Soon, people begin experimenting with their power. They want to know what it can really do. And they want to know how to control it.

Schools of thought quickly form and people begin sharing information. As new abilities are identified, people begin organizing into teams, based on the level of power they have in different areas of magic. The most powerful of these teams, the Order, is led by the most powerful of all humans, the Mage. The Mage insists that humans must wage war on the alien invaders. And the Order is determined to do just that.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide some kind of period supplies to students, especially teenagers who are experiencing menstrual cycles. If schools provide toilet paper, soap and Band-Aids, why not period products? They are a basic necessity as well. Adults are expected to provide their own supplies, which is fine. These are children, however. They are too young to be expected to be able to provide for themselves. That's why no one should fight having them freely available to students. It would be no different than denying a student a Band-Aid. 

There's two reasons that they may not be provided. It would be funding or an issue with the school and parents thinking it is not appropriate. If it's about financial reasons, then the school district needs to make sure to make funding for something like this available. They are not expensive products. If huge amounts of money can be put into sports then there is money available for tampons. Another reason could be it is uncomfortable for parents. That's something that is awkward to discuss but it needs to happen. Ignoring an important, natural issue is not going to make it go away. The more awareness that is brought to periods, the more likely schools are going to start providing them.

We need to just make them available to students. We can overcome obstacles as long as we aren't ashamed to discuss this topic. It's not taboo. Schools can have open meetings to discuss it yearly so it eventually just becomes a normal, boring school topic. Just like the nurse's office, bathrooms, books and pencils. Treat it like anything else and it won't be such a big deal anymore. I think that is the key to making sure that tampons are provided to all girls who need them.

In my opinion, pads and tampons are different from toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools, so  schools should not be required to provide free pads and tampons to students. These are hygiene products that are fundamental to girl’s health. But they are useless for boys. And yet, if boys find out that pads and tampons are being provided in schools, you can be sure they will demand their own thing. In this way, schools will bear additional costs to cater for their needs. Furthermore, the implementation of any type of policy requires administration. In other words, school staff would have to be diverted from their work to provide pads and tampons. We have to bear in mind that school is a place for learning, but not a place for providing hygiene products. 

I would suggest schools can sell pads and tampons inside the bathrooms at a lower- than-market price. This would support school budgets and make school sustainable. This would be more fair and economical than using public funds or diverting school staff. In addition, the girls need to take up their own responsibility to get hygiene products for themselves. We need to encourage them to develop the habit of bringing their own sanitary pads or tampons into school. This is good for them in any occasions in their life time.

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people.

Technology makes dating worse. It promotes a superficial and shallow view of people as commodities. Rather than seeing people as complex and wonderful, we are presented with a limited and basic message that says, ""here is what I'm good for."" It promotes a shallowness in which we can glance over the person and make a judgment of them based on their profile picture, or how they present themselves on a dating app.

  aking time to get to know someone is more meaningful than simply swiping right or left on a dating app.
 Technology also encourages dishonesty and being manipulative, especially with how easy it is to delete or avoid people on social media and dating apps.  ""Ghosting"" is commonplace-you don't feel like listening? Just never reply back, no explanation needed, zero repercussions. 

echnology seems to replace real, deep relationships with superficial ones.
 Because there is such a rapid decline in value of one's interactions on social media, one spends more time on it curating their own perfect image and less time searching for a real relationship with another person.

AManypeople seem to be on the hunt for perfection in the things and people they idolize.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

You didn't know what to think. It was like the world had just turned upside down in an instant. After all of these years, all of the tests and reports, they had finally found something wrong with the drug. But you couldn't help but feel like there was more to it. Why had it taken so long for side effects to show up? And why were they affecting both people who had taken the drug nearly 50 years ago and those who had taken it less than 10 years ago. At the same time? It didn't make sense to you. 
You were still trying to figure it out when you got the call.
 An old friend of yours - well, weren't they all old now? - called you up and asked you to meet with her. ""Don't tell anyone"" she said. And you didn't.

You met her at an old restaurant, one stilled owned by another of the Lost Generations. ""I need to tell you something."" she said. ""It's probably going to be hard to hear."" She took a deep breath and looked at you, the wrinkles on her face deep with concern. ""These side effects aren't side effects of the drug. They are 'side effects' of government policy.""

""What!"" 

""Shhh"" she said. ""You must remain calm. We're can't take any risks right now."" 
""What are you talking about?
"" you tried to remain calm, but judging by her face it was not a good performance. 
""The side effects are the result of policy.
 Think about it, if everyone lives forever the planet can't sustain us all for long. So when the population reaches a certain point, they hold a lottery."" She covered her mouth after she said it, as if there was a possibility one of the other patrons would hear.

Oh god, you suddenly understood. It was population control, and anyone who wasn't going to die naturally was a possible target. You suddenly thought about what a crime it was to have the government decide who lives and who dies.

""So, what do we do?"" you asked. 

""Well, we're still trying to figure that out. But I have to warn you, you're not going to like what the most likely plan is."" 
""I'll do whatever it takes."" you said without hesitation.


She looked at you with steely eyes. ""I am part of a group who foresaw this plan decades ago. We've been infiltrating the system at every level, every department, every related company. And we do have a plan. To be honest I lied just now, we know what has to be done. We don't need you, I just wanted to...warn you.""
""What is the plan?""
 

She looked at you. We are going to destroy the ability to create the drug, all current supplies, and all information related to the drug. It will no longer be available. Soon, and from now on, all humanity will live normal life spans, just like you and I will. Except for those who have already taken the drug.""
""What about them?"" you weren't sure you could go along with the plan.


She looked somber. ""They will die eventually too, rather through accident, suicide, or just neglect. Unfortunately they will have to see many of their younger relatives and friends die. But it is necessary to avoid this dystopian future for all.""
You had to admit it made sense.
 You hated it. But... your children and grandchildren didn't have the ""side effects"" yet; if this meant they could make their own choices in the future, it was worth it.

You went home and kept silent. You told no one of your conversation. And then one day the news came that the drug had been destroyed. Everyone was horrified, since the fact of the government's ""policy"" wasn't revealed. The conspirators decided that it was best faith in the government remained. It was necessary if they were to avoid a bloody revolution.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, one of the most important things that students should learn in schools is actually learning how to identify good sources of information.   While attempting to learn something new, you need to identify what is a good source of information versus a bad source of information.  For example, there are certain websites on the internet that are known for giving reliable information.  There are other websites that are not known for giving reliable information.   These sources may be good to read, but they are not reliable sources for getting factual information on a certain topic.   

This is something that can be taught in school.  For example, let's say a student is writing a paper on an ethical dilemma and wants to go get something from the internet as a source of information.   Certain teachers will only accept references from websites that are known to provide good information.   There are so many issues today in the real world where they have started the learning process on the wrong foot because they are using information from unreliable websites.

This is something that I learned during my years at school.  I would say that this is one of the more valuable lessons.  You only have a certain amount of time at school so you can't learn everything that you need to perform outside of school.  That is why you need to learn the proper way to approach learning.   I wish more adults could take a course in how to identify good sources.   We waste a lot of time on issues that could be eliminated once people realize they are using bad sources of information.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, girls need to man up and stop complaining about their periods. It's not that hard to deal with. You just have to be prepared. I have a friend who is a girl and she has to deal with her period every month. She's a very strong person and she doesn't complain about it. She just deals with it. I'm not really sure why girls complain about their periods so much. I have another friend who is a girl and she's always griping about her cramps, her leaks and her bloating. Honestly, I think she's just being a drama queen. I'm a guy, so I can't say I've ever experienced period shaming, but I'm sure it's not that bad. After all, it's just a natural part of life. And not only that, but all a period is is blood. Don't we all bleed when we get cut? I think that if girls want pads and tampons, they should just buy them themselves. I mean, they're not that expensive. And if they can't afford them, then they should just ask their parents for money. A box of pads costs about $5.00 and a box of tampons costs about $6.00. I think that's a fair price. I have no idea why girls think that pads and tampons should be free. Do I go around requesting that everything be free for me? No. I'm a responsible person and I don't expect the world to cater to me. I think that girls should be responsible too. I mean, if they're going to bleed every month, then they should be prepared. And if they're not prepared, then that's their own fault.

I just don't see any reason why pads and tampons should be free. They are totally different from Band-Aids, toilet paper, soap and other things that are already provided in schools. I mean, pads and tampons are not a necessity. They're not like food or water. They're not even like toilet paper. We all need toilet paper universally but not everyone needs pads and tampons. And moreover, not every girl needs pads and tampons all the time because periods only come once a month. So really, it's not that big of a deal. I mean, girls can just use toilet paper if they don't have any pads or tampons. And if they're really desperate, they can just use a sock or something. I have heard of socks being absorbent. I mean, it's not like they're going to bleed to death or anything. 

When it comes down to it, I don't really want to have to subsidize the cost of pads and tampons for girls. I mean, it's not my responsibility. So I don't want my taxes to go toward buying pads and tampons for girls. And I certainly wouldn't want my parents to have to pay extra taxes just so that girls can have free pads and tampons. That would be some serious BS. If girls need pads and tampons, then they should just get a job and buy them for themselves. We all need to budget our money and be responsible. We shouldn't absolve girls from this responsibility just because they have periods.",52,7,11,2,32,65,43,22,0,43,0.038461538461538464,0.21153846153846154,0.6538461538461539,0.3508771929824561

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should be worried about excessive screen time during the pandemic.   Staring at electronic screens can have bad effects on our health.  Our eye health can be adversely affected by the increased screen time.  More screen time may cause us to get less sleep.  An adequate amount of sleep is a necessity for our health.   Lack of sleep has been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  Additionally, our mental health can be negatively affected.    Our health care workers should be monitoring how the increased screen time is affecting us.

Unfortunately, it looks like more screen time usage will be the norm for the near future.  We are not seeing a decline in COVID-19 cases.   There are school systems that began this year with in-person classes that may be going back to virtual due to the COVID-19 cases.   Some offices are continuing to keep their workers at home.   This is a very bad sign.

I think it is best to limit the amount of screen time possible.  That maybe hard when it comes to work and school.  However, for entertainment, it is possible to reduce our screen time.  People can focus on outdoor activities instead of staying inside to play video games or watch streaming shows.  People can also choose to read books instead of staring at their electronic devices.  

We are experiencing an unprecedented time in our lives right now.   We are experiencing a pandemic that is causing us to be more isolated than ever.  We need to be able to adapt to the situation while still maintaining our physical and mental health.

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?""

Growing up, my mother always told me that I was allergic to bees. She would tell me that I should stay away from them at all costs because it would hurt a lot. She did not want to scare me as a child, so she never told me that my allergy could be fatal, but as I got older I learned otherwise. I always avoided spending too much time outdoors, fearing that a bee would get close to me and sting me. I never told anyone about my fear of bees, and I never let it show. Outdoors, my mother always protected me from bees, but when I left for college, she could no longer protect me. She warned me many times to be careful on my own. I always told her that I would be fine, but deep down I was terrified. I stayed in doors as much as I could in my first two years of college, quickly running from building to building in order to avoid any bees. I always wore long sleeves and pants, even in the summer, in order to avoid any stings. My friends never questioned my actions and accepted me for who I was. y junior year of college, I decided to take a summer job in the city.
 My summer job was being a waitress at a hotel spa/pool. I had to serve customers inside of the hotel, but on occasion, I would need to go outside by the pool. One day, I met a nice boy out by the pool and we got to talking about school. I was so engrossed by our talk, that I forgot I was spending too much time outdoors. I was sitting on a lounge chair by the pool when I felt a bee land on my shoulder. The boy I had met told me I had a bee on my shoulder and I was paralyzed with fear, running back inside, hoping the bee would fly away. I got back inside the hotel and discovered that the bee had remained on my shoulder. I was about to swat the bee off my shoulder, when suddenly, I hear the bee say, ""Your Majesty, what are your orders? I could not believe my ears, I thought I might be hallucinating from a bee sting. I looked around and saw that no one else was in the room, so I decided to ask the bee a question. ""Did you call me Majesty?"", I said to the bee. ""Yes, I am your Majesty's personal bee."" I told the bee that my mother had always told me that I had a deadly allergy to bees, so I lived in fear of bees. The bee told me that I did not have a deadly allergy, and that my mother had lied to me. I wondered why my mother would lie to me about something so strange. The bee told me that my mother had lied to me because she was a bee queen, and she wanted to protect me from her enemies. I asked the bee who my enemies were and the bee said that my enemies were the wasps. I had never heard of wasps, so I asked the bee what they were. The bee said that wasps were the ancient enemies of bees, caught in a long war throughout the centuries. The bee told me that I was the princess bee, and that I was the only one who could end the war between bees and wasps. I asked the bee what the first order of business was in the war against the wasps. The bee told me that the first order of business was to find the wasps' queen. The wasp queen had been living in Europe, all the way across the world from my home. I told the bee that I would go to Europe to find the wasp queen. I boarded a flight with my personal bee in tow, and flew to Europe. I found the wasp queen's home in a small town in Germany. I was about to walk in to her home , when suddenly, my mother arrived before me. She told me that she had known about my plan to come to Europe to find the wasp queen, and she had come to stop me. I told my mother I had to do my job as the princess bee and stop the longstanding war. My mother told me that the war had been going on for so long, that it was pointless to stop it. Nevertheless, I pushed my mother aside and knocked on the door. An old woman opened the door and I asked if the wasp queen lived here. The old woman said that she was the wasp queen, and I told her that I was the princess bee. She had been expecting me for many years and invited my mother and I in. We sat at her table and she told me that she had been waiting for me to come and stop the war. She had been the leader of the wasps for far too long and had seen many casualties. The war between bees and wasps was pointless in her opinion and she wanted to make things right. I told her that I agreed with her, and that I wanted to make things right. My mother, the wasp queen and myself agreed to end the war and we signed a peace treaty. The treaty also established a partnership between bees and wasps, so that we could work together and build a better world.

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, being outraged about what goes through the heads of others is an unproductive way to do activism. At the end of the day, it's not about what people think, it's about what they do. While 40 percent of people may have said they would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist, it's another matter entirely what they would do in real life if faced in that situation. 
The fact is, most people don't want to think about the suffering of others. at all, whether they're human or animal or even a plant. Humans are emotional and sympathetic creatures, with a vibrant capacity to feel pain; thus, we will often do anything to avoid those feelings of pain. It's important to recognize that it can often be easier for a human to ruminate on the suffering of an animal as opposed to the suffering of a fellow human, because the animal is more distant to us and therefore harder to empathize with completely. This doesn't necessarily speak to any given human's true morality, but rather their emotional coping mechanisms when faced with difficult moral questions.

The question of whether it's wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering is a fallacious one. In fact, activists can care about multiple causes at once; it's not a zero-sum game. Much in the same way that somebody can care about ending homelessness and ending racism, somebody else can care about protecting animals and protecting humans. There's never anything wrong with caring, because caring about something does not preclude the possibility of caring about other things, whether they're ""worthy"" causes or not. Suggesting that one group (or species, as it were) is more important and worthy than another is simply a way to divide people who could otherwise be driven to unite over the same cause. Instead of a world where people have to choose between animals and humans, why not a world where everybody cares about both?

Animals and humans are both worthy of our empathy, and it's important to recognize that. Life itself is precious, and we should all be working together to protect it. While ""working together"" may not necessarily mean volunteering hands-on at a farm or attending the same pro-rights protest, it does mean respecting the decisions that each individual makes about where to devote their time, energy and compassion. Our job as activists isn't to spy over the shoulder of our neighbors, waiting for them to slip up or have the wrong priorities, but to support each other in the causes that we all care about. There's nothing wrong with caring about both animals and people too, because at the end of the day, the most important thing is that we care at all.",25,7,13,0,5,15,5,10,1,4,0.0,0.52,0.2,0.4341880341880342

In my opinion, excessive screen use is always going to be a problem in our society whether it is a pandemic or not. I think that since screens are simply a part of our lives now, it really only depends on how it is used. I would say that the majority of people without a doubt abuse it, however there are some that use it an extremely productive ways. I think that during the pandemic specifically, social media and screens is really the only thing that made us feel connected. Without social media, i think the pandemic would have felt a lot more lonely. We would have felt like we were living in the early 20th century or something like that. I think this would have made people go crazy. People would have been fighting over resources and fending for their lives like it was an apocolypse simply because it is so different to how we live today. So overall to me social media is what helped the pandemic a lot, but of course with any positive comes a negative. Social media also caused a lot of depression and mental issues. People would see others and be upset that they could not spend time with them, or see people doing fun things and feel like their life is super monotonous. Social media is truly a double edged sword. I think it should be embraced, but also used in moderation. People abuse it and then wonder why they feel awful. Social media is a hotspot for comparing your lives to the lives of other people. It is very difficult to be content with your own life if you are always watching the highlight reel of others lives. If used in moderation, i think you would give your chance more of an opportunity to experience these things and realize that your life is pretty great as well. So in conclusion, i think screens have won in a way, and we should embrace them. We just need to be sure that we are aware that too much of anything can be bad, and if we overuse these sort of tools than we are only setting ourselves up for failure. I wouldnt even be opposed to schools having classes on different ways to use modern day technology since there are so many positive ways to do so. People can create their own brands on social media. People can learn valuable skills and meet new people using technology. Dating is so much easier with these different apps you can use nowadays and it has led to many happier lives all around.

In my opinion, this topic needs to be decided by the girls and mothers in each school district. It's not really fair for me to comment on something like this but my opinion would be to obviously provide tampons and pads for female students in school. 

When I look at a topic like this, I ask myself what the downsides are of the schools providing these items to students. I really can't think of any as long as they are distributed in a discreet way. 

I don't think anyone wants to have a teacher walk into a class and hand students tampons. All eyes will be on them and they will be vulnerable and embarrassed. 

To me pads, tampons, toilet paper, paper towels and soap are all basically the same thing. They all involve personal hygiene. They all are items designed to help keep us clean. Why should there be a differentiation between the items?

The only difference I see between items such as tampons and pads and items such as soap is that tampons and pads are embarrassing to talk about and receive. 

I feel like tampons and pads have the same stigma that condoms have. They're items that are somewhat embarrassing to buy. And that's a shame. Because ultimately nobody should have to feel embarrassed about buying things that are used to protect them.

My opinion is simply that each school should have an anonymous vote where only the female students are allowed to vote. Whatever they say goes. That is the best course of action and also the most fair.",24,7,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.7083333333333334,0.0,0.5167173252279635

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid. They are effectively workers, that work diligently at their jobs, and or train hard to do their work at peak performance. Many college athletes juggle countless other obligations such as their education, including classes and or social obligations. For them, it is difficult to find accommodating work, that pays well and allows them to still remain in college. If cllege athletes are not paid for their work, athey are thus orced to pay for their own equipment, travel expenses, and other costs
 which can incur debt and critically affect their finances. It is fair to compensate and pay college athletes for their work, they help generate a revenue for their college, which itself can be used to pay for many of its services and facilities, in addition to other types of expenditure.

The consequences of paying student athletes at a college level includes the possibility of a bidding war among colleges, which could lead to an increase in tuition fees. Having high performance student athletes can incur significant costs for the college, who desires top performers for their teams as opposed to cheaper athletes which may not produce as much revenue as more costly athletes. In addition, having to pay student athletes can lead to a decrease in the number of students who are able to attend college, as the cost of tuition fees may be too high for many families as opposed to colleges which do not have to raise tuition's to compensate for the costs associated with student athletes. 

Overall, student athletes should be compensated for their work, as it is an ethical choice that can help them continue their educational career, and avoid going into debt as they perform. However, the consequences of paying student athletes should be considered by colleges, and care must be taken to better handle its finances. Ideally, student athletes should be equally paid regardless of performance or notoriety. This avoids many colleges from starting bidding wars to get the best athletes, and or spending too much to pay for its athletes at the cost of other cutbacks.  The pay offered to athletes should accommodate their school and personal needs, being equivalent to a full-time job that other students may hold. They should still be provided the opportunities of scholarships and grants, to help them continue their education, and avoid going into debt. That way, student athletes can still continue to compete for their colleges, and bring in the revenue which can help and aid other facilities and students in the college.",24,9,8,0,7,11,7,4,1,6,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.2916666666666667,0.454855195911414

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are not a sufficient replacement for real books. I don't listen to audiobooks because I consider myself to be a visual learner, and while I suppose that good audiobook narrators aim to cater to me, it's just not the same for me. I really have to be seeing it in my mind's eye if I'm to get the full effect of a story. If I'm just listening to someone read it, I don't feel one bit of emotion or connection with the characters. And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to ""switch off"" when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering.

This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own. Sometimes, listening to the audiobook version of my science textbook is sufficient to recall the information I need for an exam - although I will caveat that it is not sufficient to really understand it. So I'm not in any way trying to demonize audiobooks by saying that I don't use them. I definitely do. I just think it's important to point out that I really don't enjoy listening to them much because it isn't the same as reading a real book.

Reading a real book really helps me to get invested in the story and characters. And I always find that I 'm more easily able to form a real, deep connection to the characters of what I'm reading if I can see them and visually connect to their words. Usually when I read, my mind is actively visualizing the book's imagery, which I find is something that can't quite be replicated when listening to someone else read it to me. 

I've had some friends tell me that they really enjoy audiobooks in part because they can make up their own interpretation of the story when they aren't seeing it played out the way the author intended on the page. I can understand this viewpoint, but I don't find much value in it. After all, couldn't I just retort that people don't really know it could have been intended any other way? And who's to say that an audiobook vocalist doesn't force his or her own views of a book or plotline on their listeners? I have never felt that I couldn't make up my own interpretation of an author's ending in a book that I had in my hands. So my friends' perspective seems very skewed to me. It could just be their bias, though, because I know how much they enjoy hearing audiobooks on the regular. 

In conclusion, I am happy to stick to reading real books. I think that there's a lot to be said for the real, tangible relationship between a reader and their pages. Plus, there's definitely a lot to be said for the tactile experience that a real book allows - that's a whole other argument for another day.",33,7,6,0,20,25,21,4,0,21,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.6060606060606061,0.37392550143266473

In my opinion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible. I think the crux of learning independence and responsibility comes from learning personal finance. I think it is important for students to learn how to manage their money and how to make good financial decisions. It's interesting, though, because most schools don't teach personal finance. In fact, most schools don't even teach economics. This is really unfortunate because plenty of students in America graduate high school without knowing how to balance a checkbook. This is a problem because they are going to be making financial decisions for the rest of their lives. And if they don't know how to manage their money, they are going to be making bad financial decisions. It's just going to be so problematic for the country if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults. We already have a debt problem in this country. Did you know that the average American household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt? And that's not even counting student loans. So if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults, we are going to have a lot more debt in this country. Debt could really threaten the future of the country, because if people don't have money to spend, then the economy is going to suffer. So I think that personal finance should be taught in schools. Even elementary school kids should be learning about money.  For example, they could have some play money to buy little toys with from a classroom store, and then they would be forced to learn about budgeting and saving. They could earn the play money through exhibiting good behavior. Then, when they get to middle school, they should be learning about how to manage their money in a more advanced manner. For example, a classroom activity could simulate taking out loans. And when they get to high school, they should be learning about personal finance in an even more advanced manner. For example, they could be given a budget and then they would have to figure out how to spend their money in a way that would allow them to not only pay for college tuition but also their future kids' expenses and their retirement. 

The most important thing that I learned in school was how to be a good writer. This is unfortunate because I don't think that writing is the most important thing that students should learn. As I stated previously,  personal finance should be the topic that is most important to learn about. I genuinely don't think I learned much that really affected my life or that will be helpful to me in the future, because I don't think I learned anything that will help me in my career. I'm not a writer by any means and in my job as a line cook, I don't need to be a good writer. All I need to do is follow recipes and cook food. I can definitely do that without being a good writer, and it doesn't take a genius to grill a hamburger or make a grilled cheese sandwich. But honestly, as a line cook I definitely have problems budgeting my money. I don't make a lot of money, so I have to be really careful with how I spend it. And it would have been invaluable to me to learn about personal finance in school. Now, all I can do is try to learn about it on my own. That's obviously really hard and I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it. So that is why I am making the case for personal finance to be taught in schools. It can really help people in the future, and make their lives more comfortable too.",42,6,8,1,27,46,31,15,0,31,0.023809523809523808,0.19047619047619047,0.6666666666666666,0.34801136363636365

---

In my opinion, there are three most important things that everyone should learn in school. The first one is very basic but very important and that is literacy, meaning to read and understand language, as well as be able to write language correctly. People that have mastered this skill are better at writing resumes, reading quickly, and even communicating in general. 
Another one of the most important things for children to learn in school is the study of history. It is so important to understand your own history in your home country as well as the history of what has happened at a larger global level. This helps a student better understand the present and allows a student to fully grasp and understand the larger implications of history. It also makes them more competent people in the eyes of others if they have a grasp on historical knowledge. 
hird and last but not at all least, the study of science should be  studied seriously by students. Understanding the process behind testing a hypothesis in an experiment is part of learning how we understand the natural world around us. What could be more important? Students should learn about many branches of science. They should learn about other living things, and how we are all connected in an ecosystem. Through understanding this, people can realize how we are connected and how everything works together on the planet. I know science was the most important thing I learned as a student, because it transformed how I see the world and taught me to ask questions.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has affected dating and relationships in both a positive and negative way. As far as positives go, dating apps make it easier to see a wide selection of potential people you can “swipe right” on, so most times you're more likely to find a potential match. This gives you a much wider dating pool than you would have in the past, and increases the opportunities of finding a potential mate. When it comes to something like Netflix's positive effect on dating, the amount of access to shows that appeal to all different tastes makes it easier to find something that is compatible with both your interests, and those of your potential mate. It's minor, but it doesn't hurt to be able to watch something you already have in common. The positives of social media related to dating and relationships come from the fact that you can socialize online, and develop your feelings for someone in a virtual way by sharing photos, blogs, photos. In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face. The positive effects of texting on dating and romance are that, unlike over the phone, there is little pressure to answer or make conversation. This allows for a lot more space and privacy, which many find much more comfortable when it comes to dating.

Of course, these things also have their negatives. Dating apps can increase the likelihood of being matched with someone you aren't compatible with as well as someone you are, which can make dating frustrating and disappointing. Netflix can make it so easy to just chill and watch something with someone that you don't put in as much effort into making conversation, or truly getting to know them. Social media can make it easier to keep up false appearances, which can lead to lying to your partner and hiding things. And texting makes it easier to hide your feelings and intentions from a significant other, which can be damaging to your relationship when those feelings and intentions rear their head in real-life settings.

I have not used dating apps, but as far as social media and texting goes, I find them discouraging in terms of meeting someone. Then again, I had the same issues with traditional dating in the past, so I suppose that's just me. I think ultimately that dating is still dating, and relationships are still relationships, no matter what changes one might make to them with technology. People who had an easy time with dating in the past, still will, and those, like me, who have found it a struggle, will continue to struggle, regardless of apps or Netflix.",26,9,1,0,16,22,20,2,0,20,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.6153846153846154,0.4555765595463138

In my opinion, they are not being bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news, but they ARE harming themselves and potentially others by not understanding what is going on in the city, state, country or world.  
When people don't keep up with the news it becomes easier to separate themselves from everything and everyone else.
 Initially, you aren't aware the problem exists, then when you finally become aware that it IS a problem, you don't think it will affect you and you ignore it. You dismiss it and it becomes easy to focus on the only things that ""matter"" to you, which becomes narrower and narrower.

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

Firstly, app-driven dating is massively ubiquitous. You can't escape it.

People say it encourages lying and misrepresentation. I don't think that's true. Did people start lying to potential romantic partners when they started using dating apps? Or was it always there? Clearly the latter.
I think it's just a new medium for the same old human behavior.
 Imagine a nice guy who's lonely. He goes on a dating app and what does he see? A bunch of pictures of women who are 5'10"" and look like models. Or a bunch of men who look like Olympic swimmers.
And then he sees his own picture.
 Does it compare? Heck, no! So he lies about his height, his weight, his income, his job, whatever. Is this wrong? Only if the pool of dating partners are all scrupulously honest, which they are not.

So our friend, like most people, begin to apply corrections to what they see in the app. 5'10"" is 5""6"". 120 pounds is 150. A full head of hair becomes thinner and more sparse. People who love the outdoors become couch potatoes who like to watch the Nature Channel.

And so on. So the question we must ask ourselves is, how bad is this?
I think it's not bad at all.
 Because when two people meet, there is either a spark or not. If a spark is there, they all is almost immediately forgiven, especially if the misrepresentation is mutual.
If there is no spark, then the misrepresentation is irrelevant.

So what's the problem?

In my opinion, it doesn't make a person a bad citizen if they don't keep up with the news. There are a lot of negative news stories that I don't want to hear about, and that is the main reason I don't watch the news in general.

I don't think it is a person's responsibility to know what is going on in the world. That is a personal choice. If a person wants to be informed obviously they should pay great attention to the news. It's not a responsibility though. Anything that is extremely important will be told through the grapevine anyway.

Staying up to date with current events can help people but I don't think it's bad if you don't stay up to date. This goes on a local, state and federal level. I don't see how knowing about a murder in New York City is going to affect me when I live on Long Island.

All that news is going to do for me personally is make me sad. I don't want to hear about murder. I don't want to hear about people dying, getting robbed and all things like that. It instantly will take me from a good mood to a bad one.

I only want to be surrounded with positive information. I know that's impossible but just avoiding the news does help big time in that regard. 

We aren't bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news. Possibly ignorant to many things that are happening around us but sometimes ignorance is a very good thing. Sometimes not knowing something allows it to not have a negative affect on you at all.

I keep up with the news on social media because if a story is big enough, I'll see it on my timeline. That's the way that I like to see my news, and that's the way it's going to stay.

Though long forgotten, old books and websites mentioned it or alluded to it. Our seer, in recent past times, JK Rowling even raked in billions because of it.

Now, as the mugs are being sent out to all the dads in the world with their ranking, everyone will know where you stand in the order. How do you get yourself into the top spot? Is there anyway to rig the list? Is there anyone in the world that you can bribe to make them tell you where they ranked, or what their ranking was? You have to formulate a plan soon since you expect your mug to arrive in the mail any day now.


What do you do?
 You see that there is a UPS truck delivering a package to the house next door. That guy is so annoying. Always doting on his kids. Giving in to their every whim and groveling over them like a fool. You know your neighbor isn't home, and you decide to sneak over to peek at his mug (which was just delivered) to see where he stands in the rankings. You sneak  around the side of your house and sidle up to the neighbor's front porch. Grabbing the package, you rush away.
You open the package and see that the mug lists your neighbor in at #4.
 What on Earth. How can that guy be ranked so high out of millions of dads. Do you get a higher ranking for not providing discipline or guidance? What standards are the rankings based on anyhow? You are so frustrated you feel like smashing the mug and screaming.

The country had chose to go into isolation 7 years ago, due to pressures from other countries in asking for its natural resources. For Larkinson had a resource many other countries desired, and that was the Larkinsonite. A metal that was stronger and lighter than steel, and could change its shape like a memory alloy. Its discovery brought economic wealth to the country, and led to great innovative strides in technology and electronics. The country was a technological powerhouse, and the world was waiting for it to rejoin the world.

However, communication from the country of Larkinson was not heard from as people had hoped on the day it had said seven years ago it would end its isolation. In fact, satellite imaging and other surveillance showed that its towns and cities were empty, having no people seemingly alive and moving. The country was completely devoid of life, and it was unknown what had happened to the country. 
The United Nations sent a team of investigators to the country to find out what had happened.
 Upon closer inspection, the investigators could not find anything that could explain why all the citizens of the country of Larkinson had vanished. No evidence of natural disasters, no destruction of their buildings, and no records of what happened during the seven years of isolation were found. The investigators could not find any clues as to what happened to the country, and they disclosed their findings to the UN, ultimately confirming that the country of Larkinson was no more. The nations of the world mourned the loss of the country, and ultimately set up a day to acknowledge the travesty that befell it.

That isn't to say that the mourning lasted forever, as the other countries of the world begin to excavate and acquire the resources of Larkinson, having made an agreement to share the Larkinsonite they would find among each other. Sure enough, the Larkinsonite was excavated from the ground, and the countries of the world began to use it to their advantage. Through time, scientists had been able to replicate the innovative material, which allowed technology to prosper even further as the nations of the world now had access to the material from the confines of its own borders. Larkinson was soon then no longer a point of interest for the world, especially so as its supply of Larkinson dwindled. In time the countries of the world began to forget the once great nation and its contribution to the world. Its isolation had been the means for its destruction, but it was also the means for the prosperity of the world. In a sense, Larkinson still exists today all around the world, as Larkinsonite is still a critical part of the electronics of every household that exist in the year 3103.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, students ought to learn how to manage their time, as well as how to effectively communicate (in such a way as to be understood). I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others.

I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons.

In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world? I don't even know what polar explorers are, but I sure am a good hostess! And does knowing what polar explorers are pay my rent or help me afford a car? No sir.

In putting forth my opinion, I don't mean to bash any other important subjects. But I do mean to shed light on some soft skills that are absolutely necessary for any student in school to graduate with, because they are so useful in the real world.",33,6,2,1,24,31,27,4,0,27,0.030303030303030304,0.06060606060606061,0.7575757575757576,0.378561736770692

In my opinion, college athletes should not b paid.
 
Their scholarships already cover tuition, room, board, books, and are sometimes worth tens-of-thousands of dollars dollars.
 Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. 

I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete. I mean, it's practically a joke, considering how most college coaches are shameless with taking players who are barely academically eligible. I mean, I know a girl named Soeurette from my high school, Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. She played lacrosse on the girl's lacrosse team and she ended up getting a full ride to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence University! And when she was accepted, she couldn't believe it! That's because she was barely eligible to play lacrosse at Ridgewood High, and she wasn't even considered a good lacrosse player. I mean, Soeurette is one of the dumbest girls I've ever met, because she is one of those sheltered kids, who know nothing of what goes on outside their sheltered bubble. 

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money. But this is what some athletes do, and then I have to step in and ask myself who is crazy here? Certainly it's not me for believing that these athletes should not get paid.",36,9,3,1,23,37,29,8,0,29,0.027777777777777776,0.08333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.4371794871794872

 In other circumstances humans might have tried to contact the aliens first. But they were so worried about Matt Damon that they didn't have time for diplomacy.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude, tis is a really good house, man.""
 Instead of trying to blow the house down the wolf decided to try and build a house of his own like that. ""Any uranium left my friend?"" asked the wolf. ""Im not sure. I think i may have gotten the last of it wolfie"". Said the pig. At that remark the wolf was upset. How was he suppose to get a house like the little pig's if there was no uranium left. Is the little pig going to have the nicest house in the village just out of luck? In that instance the wolf headed back to his home.

""I dont know if i can trust that other wolf"" thought the pig. The pig knew how special its home was, and there was no way that the wolf was going to be able to replicate what he has done with his home. You see, the little pig has built other homes before and knows exactly what it takes to build the perfect home. It was not just the first three little pigs who could build a home.

The pig thought this was a good cause so signed without hesitation. ""I am sorry to hear about this wolves. I hope this signature helps!"" The wolves scamper off. That night, another group of wolves come to the house with suitcases. ""Hello little pig! I am afraid your time is up here!

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, the only form of compensation that an athlete should get is through a scholarship for tuition and lodging.   The NCAA should not pay athletes because it would ruin the integrity of the game.  After college, the players have the opportunity to sell their skills in professional sports.   The time for the athlete to capitalize on their sports skills should not be in college.  

If college athletes are being paid, I think that puts the student in a very powerful position versus the school.   The student could demand more money, or even threaten to quit the team if they don't get what they want.  The contract disputes that we see today in professional sports would occur in college.  I think this would be detrimental for the colleges that are involved in situations like this.

Overall, I do find Cody McDavis' argument to be persuasive.  I do think that larger schools would have a huge advantage when attracting players.  If a school has access to large monetary resources, I think that increases the chances of the best athletes going to that school.   I think the smaller schools would be at a very large disadvantage.  Once the best athletes come to the bigger schools, there is a greater chance that school will be successful in athletic competitions.  This further increases the chance that the best athletes in the future will come to that school.

I think it would be very difficult to quantify how much to pay the students.  If you are not a well-known athlete, should you be paid the same as a more well-known athlete?  How do we quantify this?  I think it creates a lot of unnecessary headaches for the school.   

Overall, I think it would be better to just give the athletes a scholarship.  There are far too many drawbacks and not enough positives to students being paid.  I think that colleges need to really think hard about this issue before moving forward. ",29,9,15,0,5,7,5,2,3,2,0.0,0.5172413793103449,0.1724137931034483,0.4681724845995893

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made relationships become less serious. So many people are turning to Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, and other apps to find a quick hookup. It is never for the long term, and the statistics back up what I am saying.  Birth rates and marriage rates are dropping. The babies that are born are more likely to be born to a single-parent household. 

Technology has also caused mistrust between men and women. Oftentimes, a person represents themselves differently on social media than they actually are. They do this by posting pictures of themselves that are old, photoshopped, or make use of angles to achieve a more attractive appearance. This results in a jaded outlook on potential mates found on dating apps - people never know exactly what they're going to get, and a lot of times it's not what they were looking for, and ends up being a waste of time.

The rise of Twitch and Onlyfans sites has also damaged the relationship atmospheres. Men are spending more time alone in their bedrooms, donating money to women on cam sites just to see them, rather than making new friends and going out to bars. They donate their life savings for two minutes of attention from a girl who couldn't care less about them, resulting in them having less stability and even worse odds of finding a mate in the real world. This is leading to a large increase in the number of male incels.
Over ll, the only change I see technology bringito relationships is that tit'sdestroying them, and in doing so depriving society of any
 real hope of building a stable society in the near future. The new generation lives life in a bubble, and it's terrifying to think of what the future holds in store for humanity. I wish we could go back to the days when people met organically and in person. Those days were better, the family unit was more stable, there was less mental illness, and people, in general, were more satisfied with their lives. But with every new generation, things get worse.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, there's been stereotypes used for so long that we're kind of used to them. I don't think they're offensive, but I do think they're annoying. Most gay films for example are just not for me. I've watched some with some friends. They assume I'll like them because of my sexuality. However, I find the characters to be pretty stereotypical. I just can't relate. I guess other people can though. I can respect that at least.

Every gender, race and sexuality has been stereotyped. I think it's just a matter of whether or not you can relate to the character. If you can, you can overlook the stereotype. If you can't, it's annoying. One example of stereotypes is Too Wong Foo, thanks for everything. That movie has many stereotypical characters and elements. However, it's a fun movie so you can look past it. Many straight people who typically feel uncomfortable watching such movies enjoyed it for that reason. 
What is the Most Offensive Stereotype?
 I think people would say it is a racist stereotype. I don't think it's the most offensive. Many comedies use that as a setup for shows or for jokes. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. 

If you go into movies with an open mind then you probably won't be offended. I personally rarely get offended. I usually find it funny when people make fun of people like me. I don't think it's offensive. Some people will find it offensive obviously though. I just don't take entertainment too seriously.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive portrayal of a group of people is the portrayal of the mentally ill. The portrayal of mentally ill persons in the media is usually negative and inaccurate. Even sometimes it is offensive and misleading.  Films from the 90s and early 2000s such as Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are examples of this. Mental illness is often something people deal struggle with internally, while these films portray the mentally ill as violent, dangerous and unpredictable, often resorting to institutionalizing the affected person. 
In the film Girl, Interrupted, Susanna Kaysen is a young woman who is institutionalized after a suicide attempt.
 During the film, she encounters every stereotype of the mentally ill person to an extreme. Now if a person identifies with having a similar illness as one of these characters, it is assumed they will be as extreme as a movie character. This is not the case. These characters are not realistic portrayals of the mentally ill. By speaking openly about mental illness, we can help to break down these stereotypes. The more open we are about the true nature of mental illness, the more we can help to dispel the myths and stereotypes and be less afraid.  Eventually, the stereotypes in films will be viewed as exaggerations.",15,4,2,0,9,16,10,6,0,10,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.6,0.5787401574803149

How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, yes, schools should provide this for students and most have always provided it but at a small fee for purchase or just for emergencies.  Providing and selling tampons changed after there were cases of blood poisoning from their use and as far as I am aware selling or providing these in school is still banned.

There's no difference between these productions and say band aids, soap, toilet paper, etc.  They are for health and well fare of the student concerned and the surrounding students.  f schools are providing toilet paper, soap, and band aids, they should also provide tampons and pads.

He was half in and half out of his protective suit now and was rolling on the ground trying to get the roaches off of him. The wolf could hardly contain his laughter. Arthur was a complete mess.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

One little known but egregious offender is a 1915 movie called ""The Birth of a Nation."" In that film there were many Blacks--played by Whites! Yikes! These ""Black"" men are portrayed as stupid, violent and sexually aggressive toward White women. The film was a huge success and is credited with helping to revive the Ku Klux Klan, who are portrayed as heroes.
The film was so popular that it was re-released in the 1930s and 1940s., and used as a recruiting tool by the KKK.
The film's director, D.W. Griffith, wthough he had much technical skill and advanced the art of cinema, as a lso avirulent racist who made many films that portrayed Blacks as stupid and violent.

TSadly, he Birth of a Nation was the first film to be screened at the White House.


So let's see. As recently as 80 years ago, most people in America seemed to countenance, if not support, offensive stereotypes of Backs. Today, there have been over 300 Black Americans killed by police officers since George Floyd's death.  To say there is not a link of causality here would be laughably specious.

Can anyone really argue that movements like Black Lives Matter are not vitally necessary?
I'm not saying that all cops are bad.
 My point is that there is a massive, subterranean pool of racism in the US that makes the fact that there are some racist cops inevitable.

And Birth of a Nation is far from the only benighted example in the world of cinema. he list of movies that portray Blacks in a negative light is long and depressing.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology (specifically dating apps and social media) has allowed people to find love in a shorter period of time than before. Before, people had to go to events, parties or the typical 'networking' sites in order to find a mate. But nowadays, people can swipe/text/click their way to love in the comfort of their own homes.

I have used dating apps in the past, to varying degrees of success. I've been able to match with a lot of people before, and even had some worthwhile conversations with several! However in the end, I never ended up finding the ""right"" person for me through an app.

That's okay, though! Because even if I had met all those same people in-person, we still wouldn't have worked out. Moreover, it would have taken me much longer to find that out. And wouldn't it be a shame to spend months or even years of one's life with the wrong person, only to realize they aren't the ""one?"" 
Technology has reduced the time spent of finding 'he o""ne,'""because apps/websites/social media allow you to talk with multiple people
 simultaneously in a convenient, informal manner. You can be the person you're most comfortable being, both in real life and online, for example hanging around in your pajamas while using slang with your virtual date. Because we're all so familiar with technology and the internet is seen as a casual space, it's easier for us to be ourselves when there's a screen in front of us; contrast this with going out to a fancy restaurant with a stranger and having to awkwardly pretend to be more polite than you really are.

The effect is that chatting through an app is like a speedrun for getting to know somebody. You can get a lot of information in a small time and you can figure out much more easily whether or not a relationship is worth pursuing. It's lower stress, it's more comfortable, it's more convenient, it's more expensive, and it's a way to keep from ""wasting"" your life on dates that won't go anywhere.

So all-in-all, technology is a good thing for dating. Dating apps help us to connect with people, they allow us to build relationships faster, they allow us to be more honest with our dates, and they allow us to find the right person much more easily than before. All those things make virtual ""date shopping"" so much better than how dating used to be back in the old days, don't you think?",27,9,11,0,7,9,9,0,2,7,0.0,0.4074074074074074,0.25925925925925924,0.4834307992202729

The alien is a bit confused by the fact that the humans are not sending a rescue mission, but are instead sending a single individual.
 This was not just any individual though, this was Dennis Rodman, the man who was able to soften the heart of North Korea's dictator. If humanity thought anyone would be able to get the alien to understand we needed our Hollywood star back, it would be him.



As Dennis arrived at the spot Matt Damon was originally kidnapped, he found something very strange. The alien had not only kidnapped Matt Damon, but also the rest of the crew from The Martian. It seemed that this alien wasn't just studying Earth's culture, it was searching Earth for a way to colonize Mars for it's own alien race. Humanity was lucky these aliens were considerate enough to not want to invade and share Earth, they were just looking for a way to somehow live on a brand new and empty planet!


Dennis Rodman was able to convince the alien to send all the humans back to Earth, and to give him a chance to convince them
 that humanity had not yet figured out a way to colonize new planets. In fact, this was part of the reason the movie The Martian exists: because humanity is still longing and dreaming up ways to learn how it would be possible to live on other planets and so we try to imagine ways to do it in fictions. Unsatisfied, but understanding, the alien released the entire cast of The Martian and went back to their home planet to give the bad news to it's people.

Some ways they could be introduced at the earliest age possible would be by testing the kids to see where their strengths are and how much more help

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, some sports like extreme mountain climbing are definitely too dangerous to be called a sport. I know this from personal experience, which is really unfortunate. I have had two friends die in the mountains. The two friends who died are named Soeurette and Matt. 
Soeurette was a friend of mine from high school.
 We went to Ridgewood High School together in New Jersey. She was a year older than me, and she started dabbling in mountain climbing during college, since she studied abroad in Southeast Asia for a semester where there were abundant mountains. Meanwhile, Matt was a friend that I met through Soeurette. Soeurette and Matt met at a bar some time after college and became a couple. They eventually got engaged. Soeurette convinced Matt to try mountain climbing with her. This was a big mistake. Matt had always had somewhat of a thrill-seeking nature and was a bit of a daredevil, but he had never done anything like mountain climbing before. So he was all for trying it. 
Soeurette and Matt went to the Alps in France to try mountain climbing.
 Unfortunately, they were not prepared for the conditions they encountered. It was just days before their wedding, and they were trying to get in one last adventure together before settling down. The two of them were on a mountain called the Aiguille du Midi, which is a popular mountain for mountain climbers. It is a very tall mountain, and it is very steep. It is considered to be a difficult mountain to climb. 
Soeurette and Matt were climbing the mountain together, but they were not roped together.
 This decision proved to be fatal. They were climbing the mountain, and they were about halfway up when Matt slipped. He fell about 1000 feet down the mountain. Soeurette tried to grab him, but she was not able to. She fell down the mountain after him. She was not able to stop herself from falling, and she fell all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She died on impact, as did Matt. 
I was devastated when I heard about this.
 I had known Soeurette for a long time, and I had been friends with her for years. I was also friends with Matt, and I had known him for years as well. I was shocked when I heard about their deaths because I had never thought that they would die in the mountains. I thought that they were experienced enough to know what they were doing. But now I know that mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, and it can be fatal even for experienced mountain climbers. So today, I do not climb mountains anymore. I have not climbed a mountain since Soeurette and Matt died. 

Because of the loss of my two friends, I now take the position that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be called a sport. We shouldn't condone the sport, and we shouldn't encourage people to do it. The distinction between a sport and an extreme sport is that a sport is something that you can do safely. And for any sport that you cannot participate in safely, we should get rid of it as a sport altogether. It's in the best interests of society and athletes to do so. For extreme mountain climbing, you cannot do it safely. In fact, people love the thrill of mountain climbing because it is dangerous. That's what led Matt to try mountain climbing in the first place. I hope that people will realize that sports like mountain climbing are too dangerous to be called sports and that people will refrain from participating in them.",50,5,13,1,31,51,38,13,2,36,0.02,0.26,0.64,0.38929088277858176

She shows up at Carabou, their haunt. She notices, when entering, someone is looking at her, intently looking at her. She ignores this, and slides in beside chris at a small table. She whispers; do you see that guy over there, look over my shoulder? Chris answers yes, he's cute.  Chris encourages her to slide over and say hello. She's nervous to do this but she does it anyway, since her app is on the blink and has some new parameters, she figures she'd give it a shot. So, she smiles, walks over and says, ""Hi I'm Matilda"". He says, Hi, I'm Mitch, I'm your soulmate.

She giggles, looking away, glances over at Chris, who is nearby. She says, ""How do you know that"". Mitch replies; I'm a shape shifter and I've been dating you for 2 years. She freezes, literally freezes. She then says, NO that's not a real thing. Mitch says, watch my hand - she stares down at it, watching as it morphs into a rugged fisherman's hand, then slowly back into his original one. Her eyes are open wide. Chris then says, ""Now do you believe me? She nods yes.

She runs out of the shop, wide eyed, quick and behind her, Chris is trotting, trying to catch up.  Finally after several minutes he does. She is gasping for breath. Pale, shaking, and upset, Chris calms her. She tells him what happened. Next she proclaims that her dating days are over. NO MORE. She can't risk it, knowing nothing about Mitch or whatever his real name is, fearful, and worried. She throws away her cell phone, opts for a flip, and stays away from dating. Never again going out with a man.

She actually becomes a Nun, swearing away all men, taking a vow of chastity, and focusing on the Religious and spiritual side of life. Having seen something so scary, she must dedicate her life now, only to helping others.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. This woman's name is Lilybelle and she lives with a psychic parrot named Toots. Toots decides he's going to help Lilybelle end this crazy dating cycle. 
Toots uses his psychic powers to read the stars, thereby predicting Lilybelle's romantic future.
 Toots, however is really bad at this.
 He's also really bad at math, so his predictions are always off. He can't seem to figure out how to get Lilybelle the right man at the right time. He can't seem to put her in a room with a man who will fit her life parameters. He can't seem to get her out of a relationship when he knows it isn't right. The only thing Toots is good at is getting Lilybelle into trouble.

""Lilybelle,"" says Toots one day. ""You're going to find the perfect man for you today."" 
""Finally,"" groans Lilybelle.
 ""Let's hope he's perfect."" 
Toots takes off and Lilybelle heads to work.
 On her way, she stops in a store to buy some groceries. She meets a man in the bakery section of the store. They strike up a conversation and he offers to carry her groceries to her car. He's perfect on paper; he's handsome, he has a great job, and he seems to really like her. He also seems to be exactly what she wants in a man. He even offers to take her out on their first date that night. 
Lilybelle rushes home to prepare herself for her date.
 For once, Toots might be right about something, and what a happy surprise this is to her. She starts to get dressed, but without looking closely at her clothes, something catches her eye. She looks down and sees a large stain on her blouse. ""There's no way I'm going out with this guy looking like this,"" she says to herself. She's annoyed because obviously, this might be a bad omen for things to come with this guy. Regardless, Lilybelle is a trooper and gets her laundry done. ""Where is your date?"" Toots asks. ""We have a reservation at the Olive Garden,"" she replies. 

Toots feels a pang of jealousy, because Olive Garden is his favorite restaurant. When Lilybelle's date arrives, the guy is quite nice and charming, and Toots can tell he really likes Lilybelle. Toots feels happy for Lilybelle and goes off to play hide and seek with some neighborhood kids. 

At the Olive Garden, Lilybelle orders her favorite meal, shrimp scampi, and her date orders the chicken parmesan. They both share a plate of breadsticks. After dinner, Lilybelle suggests they go back to her place, so they can relax and enjoy each other's company, if you know what that means. They get back to her place and start getting cozy. ""Let's get on the couch,"" says Lilybelle. ""I want to cuddle."" 
She pulls him onto the couch and they start getting really close.
 She inches her hand onto his thigh and feels something she's never felt before. Her hand feels a bulge emerge from behind his zipper. She pulls back and looks at him. His face is flushed and he looks nervous. Lilybelle feels her hands grow hot. But just then, Toots appears out of nowhere and decks Lilybelle's date in the face!

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, I do not really think ""extreme sports"" should really even be called sports. Sports are competitive, and when you add that into extreme sports it really does make it dangerous because instead of taking extra precautions to make sure you are safe, you are trying to win.

I really think they should be more focus on being extreme hobbies instead. People can still do them, but if you remove the ""I must win"" aspect from them , then it will be a lot safer. Then it really could not be called a sport, but something people can do to team up with each other to help in making sure their friends (or team mates) are remaining safer from injury, or even death. 

So yes, I think it really is kind of selfish to call extreme sports a sport. Most sports teams don't really care about the other people on the other team. In extreme sports, that can be a huge problem because the risk involved is serious injury, or even accidental death. People can regret that afterwards, but the problem with that is that it is too late to do anything about it.

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

Bullying, shaming, and otherwise other negative social interactions can not only immediately harm the victims, but also have lasting effects on them that are negative as well. he same is true for period shaming., which can not only make the victim feel awful in regards to a natural body process they have, but also lower their self-esteem and how they view their bodies. If they are shamed for being unable to purchase pads and tampons, the shame can also be extended to other areas of their lives that is affected by poverty and finances, and they as a consequence may feel like they are not worthy of anything. For female students, being period shamed for whatever reasons that may be will affect the quality of education they receive, and also affect their ability to learn.

Given the negative outcomes of period shaming, schools should take greater initiatives to prevent them as well as ensure they offer safe and comfortable learning environments for their students. To do so, at the minimum, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to its students. Shools already provide other products that are necessary for students to learn.
 In addition, schools provide hygienic items such as toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products. Pads and tampons are both hygienic items that offers comfort during a stressful time for many female students, which in turn allows them to learn and further their educational career. While pads and tampons are quite similar in its usefulness and necessity to other hygienic items provided by school, there is also important considerations to be made regarding their distribution. 
FShools athat aee rquired to provide free pads and tampons,dshould o so in a way that is not
 ostracizing the students for choosing to use such products, while also providing them anonymity and privacy. This can be done by providing them in a private area of the school, such as the nurse’s office or a private bathroom. By preventing the identities of female students who receive free pads and tampons from being known to other students, they can avoid being shamed for their periods and for being unable to afford pads and tampons. Ideally, the school should also teach the students how to use both products, as well as provide them with information regarding menstruation and the female body. That way, periods can be normalized as natural body processes and female students will feel comfortable in their bodies, being free to study and learn without being shamed for having periods or for using pads and tampons.",21,7,7,0,7,8,7,1,3,4,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.42653061224489797

For one day, all the #1 Dad mugs in the world changed to reflect the true ranking of the owner of the mug. That is, the dads in the world finally learned how they rank in comparison to the others who had the same kind of mug. It was a shock to many, and the results were not what they expected. Many were disappointed to learn they ranked so high, expecting to be ranked lower to gloat they were better dads than their friends. Many posted on social media their rankings, which eventually caused groups of interested parties to collect the rankings and the names of the dad to make an official public list. The list spanned almost 10 million in total, and was an interesting read to say the least. The list did not appear to show what made one dad better than the other, but that didn't stop people from speculating. However, the most crucial part of the list would be the top 10, that is the 10 dads in the world that were the best of the best.
The top 10 were: an unusual bunch. They didn't seem to gloat to much about their rank, in fact they were certain it was a mistake and they should be ranked lower. Other dads would agree with them, mentioning they were undeserving on their rank. However, the list was final, and the top 10 were the best of the best. Nothing the other dads could do would change that. Or so many believed. 
One day, the top 10 dads were invited to a special meeting.
 They were to receive a special banquet, to celebrate their achievement and for many to hear from them about their lives, so they too can learn how to be potentially better fathers like them. The day of the banquet was struck with tragedy. The top 10 dads were all found dead, their bodies scattered all over the banquet hall. Although those responsible were never found, it was presumed to be other fathers at fault for their deaths, having poisoned the food of the banquet to eliminate the top 10 dads i the world.

JFK smiled and grabbed a beer for himself out of the cooler.  He explained that he thought he was dead, too, but about 20 years ago, he woke up in a lab.  He had be cryogenically frozen after being shot.  A team of government doctors were finally able to reconstruct the area of his brain that was effected by the shot he received to the head.

Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing these more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level. 

So it it selfish to participate in extreme sports? I would have to say not necessarily. There are too many factors that can come into play to be able to say what is or is not selfish. I believe that each individual has to look at the level of risk they are willing to endure and do what they feel is right for them.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, there's too much bad news everyday and there's just too much negativity that comes out of the news and I myself has drown out a lot of the news and specifically just ignore some of it. I have neglected news about the Korean conflicts for example or at least I'm not keeping up with it. How much deaths and cases with COVID-10 and the Delta variant is something I gloss over nowadays, me not caring about that isn't me being a bad citizen or having some kind of responsibility that doesn't matter.

The first reason why I ignore the news nowadays is my mental health. In 2020 continuing on to 2021, there has been so much negatives, deaths, accidents, disease outbreaks, issues with past governments and continued on with right now. If I think too much of the news that is being spewed out into the media, I feel like I would either become depressed or in the worst scenario: suicidal, and in my case, I made sure to not be thinking of bad news for my own safety. Personally, any news of death within my extended family and friends, as well as people posting about being out of a job for example, are something that I also dodge and avoid, and it's honestly not because I don't care about them, but because I would rather fixate my energy elsewhere.

My second reason why we can't blame people for not keeping up with the news is that they're just too much of it, with the news being reported daily, is that the news has become more biased than ever. A person that is not keeping up with the news is more responsible and more inclined to be a well-rounded citizen, but what's happening now is that uninformed citizens are being taken advantage of by the media and the government. News outlets like Fox News and Newsmax have been known for outright partisanship and this problem has only gotten worse with the introduction of the internet and with our super networks. News media outlets that have denied the importance of the vaccine and wearing masks have poisoned the public's mind with incorrect medical information and causing potential danger towards the community. They have literally killed thousands of people.

So in summary, I hope anyone reading this would just go live their lives the way you want to. Not keeping up with the news is okay as long as you know how to keep yourself safe and helpful to your community. Not actively trying to manipulate others and not becoming a victim of their short-sightedness in this world is essential to be responsible people, even if you don't keep up with the news.

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has actually really helped dating. Nowadays, there are so many couples that have met one another using a dating app. I personally feel that this has contributed to stronger relationships in general, and has also allowed people who may not have had the time to find a good relationship. For example, single mothers and fathers who have to work to support their kids have been able to meet significant others on a deeper level. Also, people who simply are not as extroverted have been able to work up the confidence to meet partners using a dating app. 

Now once in a relationship, i think technology has the ability to take away from relationships, especially if quality time with one another is lessened due to spending time on screens.  As long as present time with one another is still met, than the screen time use isnt a huge deal. I think as long as people are weary about their time spent in front of screens, and make sure to keep their partner in mind, then it is ok. I think mostly of social media when i talk about this, simply because social media can so easily be used as a negative. Social media breeds constant comparisons of your life to someone elses. This can cause you to not be happy with what you have, and always want more. This is not a good idea for relationships. I think apps for entertainment can be good however because it provides a sense of entertainment for you arnd your partner. Maybe you want to sit down together and watch a movie on netflix, or you want to simply text a family member instead of call so you dont have to get up and walk away from your partner. Apps are simply a part of our world now, and there is always going to be negatives to anything in the world. To me, it really just depends on how you choose to use apps.

In conclusion, i would say that dating apps are great for our generation. I think dating apps have done much more good than bad. They allow you to attempt to connect with someone without having to go out and physically meet them. It can be good to physically meet people, however it is not an option for everyone's lifestyle depending on the variables. So once again, just a great tool to have at our disposal as a society. Single parents simply are not going to get the chance to go out to populated places on their own and attempt to meet people. Even with this, they severly limiting their pool of people to choose from. With a dating app, there are so many more people at their disposal who they could meet. I am a huge proponent of dating apps, possibly because i met my wife on one. I also know numerous successful couples who have met on dating apps who live happy lives and have created their very own families.

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, the opinion presented by McDavis is broadly appealing, but it ignores key facts about what is already happening in college sports.  Top universities are already paying for a select few athletes, but they are doing so with perks and special treatment that ultimately does not benefit those students in the same way that fair payment for service would.  
The NCAA is a monopoly that has no incentive to change the way it operates., and sadly, there is practically a requirement that aspiring professional athletes must compete on the NCAA's terms.  

It would be great if college sports could live up to the ideal of scholars who compete as a hobby and as a way to show pride in their universities, but this is clearly not the case in reality.  College is viewed as a stepping stone by a lucky few who feel that they have what it takes to make a career out of playing sports.  They are generally given special treatment by professors who view the sports teams as a vital part of the university's balance sheet, and often are not held to the same standards as other students.  

And we should not judge the players themselves too harshly for this system, because they did not make the rules.  The NCAA and the colleges require them to work more than full time at their sport, all for the good of the school.  They do not have time to pursue a full-time education and to work to support themselves.
The NCAA's rules argainst paying these players ae designed to protect the interests of the universities and the NCAA itself, not the players.
  This means that college sports attracts only those who have the financial wherewithal to attend college while essentially doing nothing but training and competing in sports, all for the hoped-for reward of a professional sports contract after graduation.  This is not what the college athletic ideal hoped for, and we should stop pretending that those ideals are being upheld.

If we accept reality, on the other hand, and pay athletes for their service, then they can pursue their education either part time or after they have competed to their own satisfaction.  As it currently stands, however, we are just forcing student athletes to work for their institutions for nothing more than a vague promise of future riches.  This is not fair, and it is not right.

No matter how you look at it, this is either a violation of labor laws, or it is a violation of the NCAA's stated ideal of the scholarly athlete.  Nobody can, and nobody should, accept the system in its current form.  Giving students housing allowances and other forms of compensation is just a disguised form of payment, so why do we pretend that a paycheck would change anything?

I contend that the college-athletics system has evolved, and that if people are happy with the way it is set up, then the employees who are keeping it going should be paid fairly for their efforts.  If any coaches or talent scouts disagree, then I would invite them to give up their salaries and instead work for the same promises that they give to their students.",29,9,17,0,3,6,3,3,2,1,0.0,0.5862068965517241,0.10344827586206896,0.4670487106017192

The reason that the alien kidnapped Matt was because of the movie he made called ""The Martian"". They were worried about the potential of humans finding out about them. That's because Mars was a planet that had life on it after all. They lived underground. They also didn't want the humans to find out about it because of the fact that they were living on the planet. They didn't understand the concept of a movie though, and that most people did not take them seriously or as a fact. 
Matt was now taken to the underground city, and he thought it was a lot like New York City.
 He was surprised by how hospitable the aliens were though. They explained to him why they took him, about their fears. As they talked among themselves, Matt said ""Hey, I got an idea! Since my species are going to search high and low for me, why don't we make a deal with the scientists and governments of my world?"" What do you have in mind, the aliens ask him. 

Matt replies with ""If you let me go and make sure I get home, the governments and scientists of the world can stop all missions to Mars, and we will never come here again. We also will not make anymore movies about it, ever. So you can live in peace."" One of the aliens replies by saying ""Done.""

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, I think that people tend to be more concerned about individual cases, whether human or animal, more so than statistics, so I am not surprised to hear that research subjects were more upset about the idea of a dog being beaten than the idea of a human being similarly beaten.  It is a simple fact that people are somewhat inured to violence against humans because we see so much of it in the media, and yet violence against charismatic animals such as dogs or seals is both shocking and upsetting to us.  

We have to remember that this result came from a laboratory.  If people were in a real situation in which they could either stop an unfamiliar dog from being beaten, or a stranger from being beaten, I doubt that anyone would choose the dog.
I tdo not hink that iitwis rong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering, bsimply because the former grabs our attention more acutely.  Bt I do think that we need to be careful not
 make decisions that have real-world consequences using only our feelings, rather than our rational thoughts.  For example, we might oppose the hunting of whales, yet if a small community of indigenous people are only able to survive through the winter by sustainably killing one whale per year for meat and blubber, then we should not let our idealistic view of noble, graceful animals distract from the needs of real, living persons.  

As for the other question of people preferring to save their own dog, rather than the life of a foreign tourist, I cannot really judge anyone too harshly.  How many of us could truly say that we would prefer to save a stranger over a family member?  Wouldn't you prefer to save your estranged uncle even if it meant allowing two or more other people to die as a result?  People are close to their pets, and treat them as family, so it is not surprising, or unethical, for us to prioritize their welfare.  My main objection is treating the vague idea of an animal as more valuable than the real-world welfare of a human.  

This, of course, leads to more philosophical questions, and ones that I cannot give a confident answer to.  For example, is it wrong to eat meat?  Humans benefit from the nutritional density of meat, but animals are obviously harmed.  I think that this is a personal choice that each individual should make, and one that they shouldn't make lightly.  As long as they are aware of the fact that animals suffer for their convenience, then (with some serious regulations in place to prevent extreme suffering) they should be allowed to do so.  Likewise, I tend to favor animal research for medical purposes, because ultimately, a lot more suffering is prevented than is caused.  But, of course, I accept that this is not always a utilitarian calculation.  Some may feel that it is wrong to deliberately harm an animal or a human, and I respect that opinion.

In so many words, I can understand why people tend to favor the lives of highly-visible animals over the lives of unseen humans, but I do have to strenuously object.  The needs of the many, as it were, far outweigh the needs of the few.",28,7,19,0,2,4,2,2,2,0,0.0,0.6785714285714286,0.07142857142857142,0.4395770392749245

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, I think technology has a terrible influence on dating. I made a Tinder profile last year and received a lot of matches, but the problem is that none of them were good ones. One of the girls I dated on Tinder, Soeurette, is a perfect case in point. 
Soeurette and I matched on Tinder and talked with one another online for about a week before we agreed to meet face to face
 “late one night” at a local bar on the Upper West Side, in her neighborhood in New York. She was in my league — we had a lot in common and we were both in our mid-twenties — so I had my hopes up. When we met up, though, the date went awry almost immediately. Soeurette was instantly annoying and clingy and I had a bad feeling about it. I mean, she immediately told me that she wanted to be with me after just one date. And she was also coming on way too strong, even though I was obviously putting all signs out there that I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship. Moreover, she was completely green with envy when I talked about my other female friend who looked like Megan Fox. I decided I wanted to take Soeurette home with me anyways, because she was pretty hot and I knew from her figure that she'd be a lot of fun in the sack. So she went back to my place and we did get intimate. She had used her fingers on herself, but I had to do the rest, since she said she didn't know what she was doing. She said that she had only been with one guy in her life, but that was a lie. I mean, it was clear that she knew what to do, but she wanted me to think that she was naive because that would make her that much more desirable; it's pathetic how many girls think like that nowadays. After I was finished with her, I woke up the next morning, saw her sleeping on my couch and immediately gave her the boot. I mean, I just wasn't getting any good vibes from her. She immediately started freaking out, even though I had told her that I wasn't serious about having a relationship with her the night before. I mean, all I was looking for was a booty call. Isn't that what Tinder is all about? I had no idea this crazy girl was so emotionally involved with me after only one night. Even though she was a decent lay, I care a lot about quality over quantity, so I decided to have nothing more to do with her. But that didn't stop her from sending me a series of crazy texts and posting selfies of herself on Facebook, with tags to my account, over the next few weeks. I mean, technology just blew up any chance she had with me, because all of her efforts just came off as purely crazy to me. So yes, while she's terrific at making herself look all glamorous on her Tinder profile, she's a nutjob who has no one to blame but herself for giving me a negative impression of her. That's why I say that technology has made dating worse. It really allows the worst in a girl to come out sometimes. And I say this from personal experience, because I learned the hard way with Soeurette. ",37,9,6,1,21,37,27,10,0,27,0.02702702702702703,0.16216216216216217,0.5945945945945946,0.4398782343987823

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it does not make someone a bad citizen if they keep up with the news. I personally feel that media and news in general has the power to dictate how someone feels about different types of topics. If people watched all the news all the time, they would think the world was going to explode and probably be upset more often than not. I think having a general idea of what is going on in the world is smart, however overconsuming news could drive you mad. Not only this, but the media heavily favors the more negative and violent news because people are more prone to watch it. News such as a plane crash is more exciting than the president announcing tax cuts or a new way to help homeless children. I feel that not being informed is better than reading a bunch of news that may make you feel down and frustrated. Uninformed people can lead to live very happy lives. The saying ignorance is bliss can really be true in this case. 

I would not say that we have a responsibility to know what is going on in the world. Citizens can choose whether to have an impact on different places in the world, and if they choose not to than it is ok. I think people need to do what is best for their mental, and if remaining uninformed is helpful, than that is what they should do. I think people have more of a responsibility to have at least some sort of idea what is going on their country. If you do not know about the pandemic by now than i think i would agree that it was a failed responsibility. I think engaging with current events can be helpful, it just depends on your perspective. Knowing what is going on around the world helps you can perspective, and allows you to realize how lucky you are to live in a place like the US. It can also cause you to gain a negative perspective however if you feel other countries are wronging the US, or if you feel threatened by other countries. There are many feelings that can come about from reading current events. It is really up to the person to take whatever information they learn from the media and apply it to their lifestyle however they want. The news media is similar to social media in the way that it can change how you think. Social media causes constant comparison between yourself and others. News media and current events can cause constant comparison between your country and others.

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

In my opinion, older stereotypes of African Americans that were in the movies and on TV irk me a little when I see them. When I visit my parents they always have old movies on in the background and its incredible to see the difference in how they were portrayed back then compared to today. Not that they have equal status today but at least a black man can be cast as president without it being an issue. I dont think they will ever go away completely but maybe fade away as time goes on. The nation is also diversify very fast and pretty soon whites will be in the minority. There may soon be an issue with stereotypical whites at the center. Disney is notorious for this in their classic cartoons. They portrayed blacks usually as ignorant and poor. It is at the same time refreshing to see that society does come around and kind of quickly on certain social issues that  make everyone more equal but still hard to watch without that nagging voice in the back of your head saying this is wrong. One other thing that stands out is the treatment of women as simple housewives that have almost no depth. They were treated as second rate and ill informed. That too has changed dramatically. This is also good for society in general to see equality of TV because it will start to become second nature and race will not determine so many things but character and experience will.

The wolf came back with some dynamite and tried to blow the house down, but it didn't even leave a scratch.
 He tried using grenades, but they didn't even leave a mark. He tried to fire a missile, but it just bounced off the roof. So the wolf tried to drive a tank through the front door, but it got stuck in the doorway. 

The wolf was very angry. So he said, ""I'm gonna get some nuclear weapons!"" he wolf came back with some nuclear weapons, and he blew the house right off the face of the Earth.! 

 fter the 92nd little pig was blown to smithereens, a voice from Heaven spoke and said, ""THAT'S IT
!""  Lightning flickered in the clouds. ""My chosen people, the pigs, have suffered enough at your hands!""   

The wolf looked up and saw the lightning bolts. ""Oh no,"" he said, ""It's God!"" The wolf pleaded, ""No, please. I didn't mean to blow up the house!"" God sighed and said, ""Tough titties, Wolfy."" 

he wolf screamed and begged, ""No!
"" Yes,"" said God.
 ""This is the end!""  Bright lights flashed. he wolf screamed,  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!""
 Then God sent the whole house down on top of the wolf.  The wolf was squashed like a bug. 

 God said, ""Behold -- I have created pigs with the power to not only survive but thrive in a radioactive environment."" 
 And God saw that it was good.  The 26372687th day. ",35,6,3,13,13,31,26,5,5,21,0.37142857142857144,0.08571428571428572,0.7428571428571429,0.45758354755784064

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

I would definitely not watch or read something due to offensive stereotypes.  Especially, when the negative stereotype is about race.   There are old movies where actors pretend to be African-American or Asian.     The portrayal was not funny, realistic or funny at all.  For me, it takes away from the story of the movies and shows when this occurs.  It is hard for me to focus on the media due to the ridiculous, stereotypical portrayals by the the actors in the movie.

One offensive portray to me is when the actor Mickey Rooney played an Asian character in Breakfast at Tiffanys.   Mickey Rooney costume looked horrible.  His manners were bad.  It just takes me out of the movie.   It makes me wonder about the actors in the movie and their thoughts behind playing such a racial role in a prominent movie.  I understand that Breakfast at Tiffanys came out during the 1980s and people got away with a bit more back then.  

Ultimately, when I see the lazy, negative stereotypes in the media, the overall quality of the film is often not great.  I know when I see stereotypical characters that it is often a reflection of bad writing overall.  I know I probably won't enjoy the movie when I encounter stereotypical characters.  In the end, stereotypical characters do not add to the story, nor does it add humor or creativity.  

Some people may call me sensitive.  However, when I encounter stereotypical characters I will automatically stop engaging with the media that contains them.  I know there are better works in media that don't have these characters.  Why should I support subpar work?  ",24,4,16,0,4,6,4,2,1,3,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.5387096774193548

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing in school that I learned was how to reason and use logical thought. I learned how to think critically and how to apply logic to everyday situations. I learned how to use my mind to solve problems and how to think about the world around me. I learned how to think about the world and how to apply my knowledge to it. These things that I have learned did not come from one class or one grade but it was the culmination of all my schooling from kindergarten to college. I believe that this knowledge is more important know then ever before. The world is changing so fast and the ability to think critically and logically is more important than ever. From cable news to social media to your family, its hard to know who is right and wrong and it is critical that we know how to figure that out. Understanding the difference between objective facts and personal facts is key to navigating this new social order we find ourselves in. I think the recent disconnect from facts on the election and the pandemic goes to show how important it is to know what is true and what is not. It also shows how many people truly are misinformed and how much impact it has on the health and well being of a society. This is why I believe that learning logic and reasoning skills is the most important thing to be learned in school today.

0,0822cf8998be4c44962989a70f00eb9e,"Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. The power of magic, of course. After the alien bombardment, the mana has become more concentrated and the survivors have begun to develop magical abilities. As humanity dwindles, their magic grows stronger. The survivors desperately rally and attempt to use their new-found magical powers to fight back against the aliens. Successes are few at first, but as the magic strengthens, and the survivors gain skill in its employment, they begin to turn the tide.  First they've defeated a small squad of alien troopers, then a larger force, and then a mage knocks down an alien ship, and soon they're ready to take on the aliens' main base.

However, there are problems. There are few humans left, and despite their magical power, their numbers are getting fewer. Also, as their numbers dwindle, and their magic strengthens, the survivors begin to change. They find that they care more for the magic,  than for each other. They crave the power that it brings, and the way that it makes them feel, and they begin to turn on each other. The struggle against the aliens is momentarily forgotten, as the surviving, increasingly powerful magicians, fight amongst themselves for the right to wield the magic. The aliens, who had been increasingly on the retreat, use this opportunity to attack the humans, and attempt to wipe them out.

They manage to kill many of the distracted magicians, but two manage to escape.  A man, and a woman, the last survivors of the human race, and the two most powerful magicians Earth has ever known. They manage to flee the alien forces, working together, and arrange a truce. Joining forces, they easily defeat the aliens, and save what is left of the Earth.

The alien menace dispelled, they turn on each other, and fight a final battle. The male magician has the edge, and is about to strike a mortal blow, but at the last minute, his powers reveal that his opponent is pregnant. Not only that, but her child, born into the world of magic, is already conscious, and more powerful than either of his parents. The Mana Child restrains his parents, and guides them, and oversees the restoration of humanity, and the planet, into a new golden age.","{'Total number of sentences': 25, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 3, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 5, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 16}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 24, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 17, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 17}","[(3, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (4, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'],

The aliens have no idea what they’re in for.
 Immediately, Matt Damon's security, which calls themselves the Ninja Rescue Team, realizes he is missing and is ready to take action. The aliens are not ready for the Ninja Rescue Team, as they are a group of ninjas who are ready to fight to the death to get Matt Damon back to safety. The Ninja Rescue Team first had to find where the alien is hiding. They knew that the alien would be hiding in a place that was not easy to find, so they had to think of a plan. They decided to split up and search for the alien. Eventually one of the Ninjas found him hiding in a cave in the wilderness. He had Mr. Damon with him in the cave. The Ninja then had to fight the alien to get Matt Damon back. The alien was really strong so he shouted his special call to get the rest of the Ninjas there to help him. The Ninjas then all came and fought the alien. When the alien was almost defeated, he surrendered. The Ninjas then took Matt Damon back to the Ninja Rescue Center, where he was safe and sound. The alien thought he could hold a human hostage that day and get what he wanted from the humans, but it did not work out that way this time. The alien learned his lesson for sure. He also learned that the Ninja Rescue Team is not a team to mess with. He will definitely not be abducting any more humans from this day forth.","{'Total number of sentences': 18, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 1, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 8}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 10, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 8, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 6}","[(1, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (2, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (3, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (4, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (10, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{1: ['prompt', 'user'], 2: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 3: ['user'], 4: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 10: ['user', 'empty-call'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 18: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 1'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 18'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) )",DiGraph with 14 nodes and 16 edges,4,11," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"
2,11914c731ffe464791f9cb2b375f4d70,"Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---
In my opinion, audiobooks have many benefits over traditional reading. One is that people can listen to audiobooks while doing hands-free activities, such as cleaning the house or crafts such as knitting. I've personally found that such mindless activities are greatly enhanced by listening to a great audiobook while I do them. 
Another benefit of audiobooks is that you don't have to strain your eyes to read. Many people are vision impaired, making reading difficult, if not impossible with traditional books, and for those people, an audiobook allows them to be fully immersed in what they are reading. And even people with no vision impairment can have tired eyes at the end of a long work day which makes an audiobook a welcome break from the strain.Another benefit is that people can listen to audiobooks at night when the lights are down.
 I like this benefit personally because I have a partner who goes to bed very early. With an audiobook, I can still sit in the same room and enjoy it without waking him up by turning on the light.  
All in all, I think there are many benefits you get from an audiobook and I prefer it personally.","{'Total number of sentences': 15, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 5, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 3}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 3, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (14, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 14: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 15: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 15'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( 'user', 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 12 edges,0,7," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions the action 'user', the action 'empty-call', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You quickly looked over your shoulder to see what it was or who was talking to quietly to you as the voice was not something you are used to hearing and it was quite out of the ordinary. You see a small bee, not much bigger than your thumb. It's a little black and yellow striped bee. It's eyes are a bright red and it has a small crown on its head. It's wings are a dark black and it's body is a light yellow. It's small little arms are wrapped around your shoulder and it's legs are wrapped around your neck. You realize that this is a queen bee. You've never seen one before, but you've heard about them. You've heard that they are the most powerful of all the bees. They are the ones who control the hive and they are the ones who give orders. You've also heard that they are extremely rare and that they are the most powerful of all the bees. You've also heard that they are extremely protective of their hive and that they will do anything to protect it.

I can't just let it stay on me like this. It's going to sting me and I'm going to die."" You try to shake it off, but it doesn't budge. so i remain as calm as possible and try to walk it off and hoping it was going to fly away which she didn't no matter what . You try to get it off, but it won't budge. It just stays there. You start to panic and you start to sweat. You start to get nervous and your heart starts to beat faster and faster. You start to feel a little dizzy and you start to get a little light headed. You start to feel a little nauseous and you start to feel a little sick to your stomach. You start to feel a little weak and you start to feel a little woozy. You start to feel a little hot and you start to feel a little cold. You start to feel a little shaky and you start to feel a little weak.At this point i thought to myself i cannot have this bee sitting on me anymore and i ran as fast as possible thru a nearby forest hoping it would smell some flowers and just fly off onto one of them. I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran until i got so tired i fell over. At that time i noticed it had disappeared off of me and felt so relieved. From that moment on i made sure i sprayed myself with bug spray whenever i went out especially in grassy areas like the park or flower gardens. And i also made sure i always carried a small can of spray with me wherever i go from then on just to be on the safe side.   I also made sure i always wore long pants and long sleeves when i went out and i also made sure i always wore a hat and gloves.","{'Total number of sentences': 36, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 4, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 22, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 30, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 26, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 26}","[(4, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (7, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (10, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (12, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (13, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (14, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (20, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (21, array(['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (24, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (25, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (26, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (27, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (28, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (29, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (30, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (31, array(['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (32, array(['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (34, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (35, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (36, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9'))]","{4: ['prompt', 'user'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['gpt3-call'], 7: ['gpt3-call'], 8: ['gpt3-call'], 9: ['gpt3-call'], 10: ['gpt3-call'], 11: ['gpt3-call'], 12: ['gpt3-call'], 13: ['gpt3-call'], 14: ['gpt3-call'], 15: ['gpt3-call'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['gpt3-call'], 19: ['gpt3-call'], 20: ['gpt3-call'], 21: ['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['gpt3-call'], 24: ['gpt3-call'], 25: ['gpt3-call'], 26: ['gpt3-call'], 27: ['gpt3-call'], 28: ['gpt3-call'], 29: ['gpt3-call'], 30: ['gpt3-call'], 31: ['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], 32: ['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], 33: ['user'], 34: ['user'], 35: ['user'], 36: ['gpt3-call']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 4'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 36'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, *( 'empty-call', tau ) ) ), 'prompt' ) ), X( tau, 'user' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 14 edges,30,44," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions the action 'empty-call', a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and the action 'prompt' and an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'user'"
4,126ae6528ba141a58f932a3ed097b47e,"All of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world changed to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. It was awkward to say the least... Scientists couldn't tell us how or why it had happened, but needless to say, it quickly became a global hot topic and a serious issue for pretty much every family in the world. eople were losing their minds - everywhere we went, we would see people screaming at one another,: men fighting with their wives, kids in tears, brothers getting up in arms about long-forgotten sibling disputes. It was as if the whole world had completely lost their minds all at once.

It was a dark time, too. A lot of my friends lost their dads over it, either because they walked out on their families or, well... worse. Some dads managed to get rankings up in a few hundreds, and they started appearing en masse on talk shows to share parenting tips and talk about how much they loved their kids. But this only made all the long-string-of-digits dads even more riled up. There was one kind of amusing case with my sister's ex's cousin's dad, though - it turns out he wasn't even her dad! His mug went blank when he held it, and that was definitely confusing for a while until his wife came clean about the real dad. Hoo boy, I would not have wanted to be in that room when that news broke, though.

So basically, it's been rough for everybody, but we're all slowly learning to deal with it. The police have had a much easier time convicting abusive dads for one thing, and a lot of marriage counselors are making bank. Kids are less afraid to speak out about their rights as people and parents are really listening to them. So I guess that does bring a little bit of good out of it, right?

Still, the whole world is extremely obsessed with one question above all: who is the #1 dad? The answer is still a huge mystery, even bigger than why this mug thing happened in the first place. There are a lot of theories about it, of course, and everyone has an opinion, but no one knows.

No one except me, of course. I love you, dad. You've always been #1 in my book, and it looks like the mug doesn't lie.","{'Total number of sentences': 21, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 1, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 15, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 5}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 5, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(1, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (2, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (3, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (4, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{1: ['prompt', 'user'], 2: ['user'], 3: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 4: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user', 'empty-call'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 1'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 21'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 13 edges,10,13," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call'"

 Your mom laughs. ""Oh, honey, you're not getting married to the King of the bees. I hired Mikey to help you get back out there and find a man. You've been so sad since your last boyfriend left you. I thought you needed a push in the right direction. I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds. But I just wanted you to see how exciting it could be to date again, since it would be so exciting for you to plan a real wedding."" You are floored. You had never considered that your mom would hire a bee to help you find a boyfriend. Honestly, you are a little concerned that your mom would go to such great lengths. 
""So...so...so...I'm not getting married to the King of the bees?"" you ask.
 
""No honey, you're not getting married to the King of the bees."" your mom says.
 
""Oh, thank goodness."" you say.
 
""But honey, you should really consider dating again.
 You're a beautiful young woman, and you're going to be single for the rest of your life if you don't start dating again."" Your mom leans over to brush your hair. ""You're going to be a beautiful bride someday, honey.""

You protest, ""But I'm very active on Tinder."" 
""Oh honey, Tinder is not real dating.
 Find yourself a real man!""

So after that conversation with your mom, you both agree that you'll spend more time looking for nice guys out there, and she agrees not to hire Mikey again.","{'Total number of sentences': 78,

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The ones who got the immortality drug started to change. At first they got mentally slower, their bodies then began to decompose. No matter how much of a person decomposed they still lived. Then a bystander caught one of the decomposing immortals eating an old man from the lost generation. After, the immortal seemed reinvigorated and runs off instead of hobbling. Videos like this were popping up all over the internet. It seemed that if these immortals ate the flesh of a member of the lost generation, they start to heal and become mobile again. If an immortal eats enough of these regular people, they will revert completely back to the way they were before they became deformed. This was very bad news for the remaining lost generation. They were the cure for the dying immortals. The immortals started to herd up the lost generations and kept them in cages, slowly draining them of their blood and fluids. This was enough to regurgitate an immortal without killing the regular person. Soon farms of the lost generations were everywhere. It seemed nothing could stop the immortals from rounding up the remain old and frail to herd then like cattle into farms. One young boy who was born naturally long after immortality became a thing and ended up in one of these human farms. They drained him of his blood and sent it on its way. What they did not know was that the boy had a genetic anomaly that would essentially neutralize the immortals original treatment. It was and the new genes took hold, spread to each immortal turning them all into mortals again. It also healed them of any zombie like issues. The world recovered and vowed to learn from this mistake and never let it happen again.","{'Total number of sentences': 23, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 3, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 20, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 0}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 0, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 0}","[(3, array(['prompt', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (4, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{3: ['prompt', 'empty-call', 'user'], 4: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user', 'empty-call'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user', 'empty-call'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 3'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 23'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, 'prompt' ), +( X( tau, *( 'empty-call', tau ) ), *( 'user', tau ) ) )",DiGraph with 10 nodes and 12 edges,41,42," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'prompt' and  in parallel with an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions the action 'empty-call', a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and a loop between the actions the action 'user', a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I dislike the portrayal of the ""evil"" stepmother in fairy tales. I think it is one of the worst villains in literature. This character requires a fundamental type of cruelty that is hard for someone like me to understand. I can't imagine being so cruel to someone else's child. It makes this villain one of the worst stereotypes.  This is probably what makes them so interesting in a story though. They are so evil that they are fascinating. And they give the story lots of ups and downs and twists and turns. Their evil nature and undertakings make the main character so much more likable.  The good versus evil theme is prevalent in most stories. It is what makes the story interesting. Still it is very hard to watch a story that centers around family abuse. It is hard to watch a story that centers around abuse of any kind. I think that is why I don't like the portrayal of the evil stepmother. But it is something that really makes the main character shine and turn them more toward doing good in their life.

8,153d73ea68dc4323af5341ce6c51ea73,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
The 92nd little pig said, ""you can't come in,"" and the wolf was like, ""I'll huff and I'll
 puff and I'll blow your house down!"" The little pig, named Arthur, just laughed. And the wolf said, ""what are you laughing about?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because I have made my house out of a nuclear waste material.
 I'd just love to see you try to blow my house down!"" 
And the wolf was like, ""I don't get it.
 Why would you make your house out of nuclear waste?"" 
And Arthur said, ""because it is the strongest material there is.
 I mean it's so strong, that you can't even blow it down!"" If the wolf loved anything in this world, it would be a good challenge. So the wolf gathered all of his huffing and puffing into one big gulp, and he took a big old blow at Arthur's house. 
But when he blew, Arthur's house didn't budge an inch.
 The wolf was so mad, and he tried again. He kept trying and trying but he just couldn't blow the house down. But the wolf did not want to admit defeat. He did not want to embarrass himself by proving Arthur right. So he kept puffing and huffing until he thought that his head was going to explode. 
Arthur, who was really enjoying this, said to the wolf ""wow, you are going to have a really bad headache when you calm
 down from this. Do you want me to get you an aspirin?"" The wolf was angry and frustrated by Arthur's goading. He was really determined to get into this house, and he tried again. But this time, he didn't try to blow the house down with his own breath. He instead used a grenade. He threw the grenade at Arthur's house and he blew his own brains out. That house, which was made of depleted uranium, set off like a rocket bomb when the wolf blew it up with a grenade. The wolf never even knew what was coming and certainly did not need an aspirin after the number the grenade took on him!

So now the 93rd little pig, named Matty, needed to figure out a new living situation. He knew that the wolf had not succeeded in blowing down his brother Arthur's house with his breath alone, but he also did not want to live in such a house because it was a radioactive pigsty. That just wouldn't do for him in the long-term. So he started to look for a new place to live. He thought and he thought and he thought. And then he had an idea. 
The 93rd little pig went to the nearest Wal-Mart.
 Matty scrounged the aisles of Wal-mart for supplies. He found some steel-toed rubber boots, some heavy-duty gloves, hardhats, and finally he ran into the paint department where he found some spray-on lead paint. With those items in hand, he began to build a house. He started with the foundation. He used the lead paint to coat the foundation of his new home, and he coated it heavily. He coated it so heavily that it looked like an old Victorian house with gingerbread, but more industrial. He looked back to admire his work. The lead paint made his house similarly indestructible as Arthur's house had been, but there would be no risk that this house would blow up with a nuclear grenade. Matty invited his brother Arthur to stay with him in the new house. He needed a roommate. 
Matty and Arthur enjoyed living together in the new house.

The people feel tricked. The rest of the world was progressing while the United States was isolating. The world is now very advanced, and the US is just catching up. The rest of the world now wants to help the United States recover, they want to show that they were not wrong in going into isolation.

But people are also interested in things that make them successful. Once the US proved to other countries that they have helpful knowledge to share they were under much less of a threat. Many people want to do the right thing but also think of themselves. It is also human nature to be self-centered. It was up the US to balance these needs to fight and think of yourself.

Obama knew this day would come. He knew he would be called back into action. JFK had been preparing him for this day for years. He knew that Obama would be the one to save the world. It all begins with the note. 
The note is the first step in a long journey.
 He already had his bag packed, just in case. He went and fetched his packed bag from the closet, where it had sat for the last 6 years. He grabbed his phone and dialed the number on the note. It rang 3 times, and then was answered by an automated service. ""Please enter your code."" Obama did exactly as he was instructed, and entered no code and said nothing while the phone waited for his response. After a few seconds, the automated voice came back on the line. ""Please re-enter your code."" Obama did not respond, and the phone hung up on him. He waited for a few moments, and then the phone rang. ""Yes,"" he said in a low voice. ""I'm here."" said a voice on the line. ""Back door."" Obama hung up the phone and walked to the back door of his house. There he could see JFK standing under the porch light in a trench coat, looking intense. He opened the door and let JFK in. ""Let's go."" said JFK. Obama grabbed his bag, and as instructed, threw his phone into the garbage with the browser open, allowing it to drain the battery faster.   ""What's going on?"" ""Not now. Let's just move."" Obama and JFK walked out of the house and got into JFK's car. JFK started the car and drove off. JFK finally started to look a little relaxed. ""So, you ready for this?"" Obama just waited for an explanation. ""I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house. We need you to oversee operations there."" ""What about the old white house?"" JFK paused for a moment, and then replied, ""We're going to need to blow that up."" Obama was shocked. ""Why?!"" ""Because it's a trap. Are you on board?""

11,1ab526811cb04829be91e2ac7fd18b67,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, schools should provide free pads and tampons to anyone who needs them. 
 think it's important to understand that pads and tampons are not luxury items.
 They are an absolute necessity for health and function and if a student struggles to afford these items through no fault of their own, they would benefit immensely by having schools that provided them free of charge. Pads and tampons are vital in the same way that Band-Aids, toilet paper,  and other hygiene items are. In some countries where girls have less access to pads and tampons, school is not an option during a female's period. n the United States, there are many people who struggle to afford pads and tampons. and our school system can surely help meet this human need that most all women have. 
I have myself experienced period shaming. Without the right product a girl can have an accident that is evident to other students who may see this as an opportunity to humiliate someone by pointing it out to others or laughing. It's sad that young people sometimes act in this way. But, it's even sadder for the person (me) who is literally traumatized by someone ""period-shaming"" them. 
Schools should step in to help prevent this from ever occurring. And they should provide tampons and pads to the students that need them at no cost.

12,1c5622c21c424b91a8325faa0c5e753e,"How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, I think apps like Tinder, speed dating and social media like Twitter and Facebook improve dating and relationships by helping people expand their social, occupational and geographic environments. or instance, with apps like Tinder and online dating, you can explore relationship opportunities in different parts of the world without ever leaving your neighbouhood.
 Shy people can interact with people they would never normally speak to, and introverts can talk to more people than they would ever even consider meeting. ocial media sites like Twitter and Facebook connect us to friends, acquaintances and strangers with whom we otherwise would never speak.
 f I lived in a remote part of Alaska, I would benefit from technology to meet new people and get together with existing friendships.
 

Technology also helps a quick match of potential partners. For instance, if you are looking for an ideal marriage partner, online dating sites can help you find someone with complementary interests. Dating apps like Tinder and other technology help you screen potential mates and avoid the “sunk cost” of wasting your time on someone unsuitable. Tinder allows you to “try out” potential partners so when you finally meet, it’s not a complete surprise. On online dating sites, you also have the opportunity to use profile photos, multiple photos and a range of writing styles to help choose a mate. inder and other dating apps allow you to quickly evaluate a large number of potential partners in a short period of time.
 There is no guess work of wondering whether this person is for you.

As a conclusion, I think apps like Tinder, speed dating and social media like Twitter and Facebook improve dating and relationships.","{'Total number of sentences': 21, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 3, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 9}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 13, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 12, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 8}","[(9, array(['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'],

You go out to run some errands, and find a swarm of bees following you. You're not sure how you feel about this. You head into the bank to make a deposit. The teller looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees. Then you hear screams, and there is a rush for the exits.

You look down, and notice an opened drawer with stacks of crisp hundred dollar bills. You glance up, expecting to see a security camera. It is there, but the lens is smeared with honey. You grab some cash and run. The bees follow you.
You're not sure what to do with all this money.
 You decide to buy a new car. You head to the Mercedes dealership. The salesman looks at you funny, and you realize that you're covered in bees again.

 You don't see any bees. You feel very, very tired. Being a bee majesty is not all its cracked up to be.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. Only this time it is not a force of destruction. It is a power of creation.  As the  numbers of humans left alive dwindle,  the old effects of Mana have begun to return, and the ability to wield powers has begun to re-kindle in some individuals . But the process is too slow help humanity as a whole.  So to accelerate the process, a group of survivors have begun to experiment with ways of artificially accelerating the growth of Mana.

They hit upon an ingenious stratagem: in order to grow stronger, they need to expose a single human to all the world's mana, and tap into the energy of that single human soul. They develop a chamber made of a material that can contain mana, and a brave individual volunteers to remain inside.  his chamber is called the Transference Chamber.
 The volunteer who will receive all the mana, will be known as the Conduit.

So as alien bombardment continues, and the situation growing increasingly perilous, mana flows into the Transference Chamber, and the Conduit absorbs it. The effects are rapid. The Conduit rapidly begins to evolve, becoming a Mana user capable of superhuman feats of magic. These powers grow as the mana exposure continues, and very quickly, he reaches a level of power that might be sufficient to tap. The experimenters release him from the Transference Chamber.

ut there is one problem.
 The Conduit refuses to have his soul tapped.  His power, as well as his thought, have evolved beyond human ken. He has become an otherworldly being in human guise. With a wave of one hand, he destroys all the alien forces. The researchers are grateful, they believe they have been saved. But the Conduit is not human, and the remains of humanity are no more kin to him than the aliens were. He waves his other hand, and destroys the pitiful remains of humanity.

---

In my opinion, college athletes should be paid.  At the root of this belief is the fact that they are risking their health and thus their future by participating in high-risk sports like football.    Even if a college athlete is lucky enough to stay healthy, they can still sustain life-long injuries and be unable to pursue any other career path.   The concussion syndrome linked to contact sports like football is a prime example.

College athletics has become a huge money machine.  Big sports program schools have been willing and have paid top dollar for a few select athletes so that is not going to change.  College athletes should be given the opportunity to receive compensation as well.

The way to resolve this is to make college sports just that college sports.  The focus of a college should be education, sports is what is done in free time from studies.  After all, there is no college curriculum for 'pro football player', no degrees are offered for 'professional athlete'.  College athletics was never meant to provide a career.

For those whose focus is a career in professional sports there should be a junior league much as baseball has the minor leagues.  Education should be provided in the areas that would most benefit a professional athlete, like money management, etc.  

Colleges with big sports programs would protest this mightily but then they need to refocus their sight on providing an excellent education for all their students.

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is how to think critically. This is an essential life skill that is often overlooked during education. 
The most important thing I have learned in school is how to think critically.
 I have learned how to think about a problem, come up with a solution, and then evaluate the solution. Critical thinking is a method that is taught specifically in higher education for certain professions, such as healthcare professionals. However, it is not taught in a general sense. I think that critical thinking should be taught in schools from a young age. Ideally this would be taught in a small classroom size setting, where the teacher can work with each student individually. This would allow the implementation of a more hands-on approach to learning in all subject areas. 
IAnother way to increase critical thinking in early childhood education is by homeschooling. Homeschooling allows the parent to tailor the curriculum to the child's needs. Also, the child participates in elements of everyday life at home with an adult , which allows them to learn how to think critically in a more natural setting. By shadowing adults as they work through everyday problems and problem solving, children are able to learn how to think critically in a more natural setting. This allows for a smoother transition into higher education and working age.  I promote and support any form of teaching that allows for more hands-on learning. I think the benefits are enormous and will improve the lives of students.","{'Total number of sentences': 21, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 4, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 11}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 16, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 12, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 12}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (12, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user',

You dream about the bee telling you that you are the queen of the bees, and that you must lead them to victory over the humans.  You dream of transforming into a bee, and stinging all the humans you have ever know. You wake up in a cold sweat, but you are still you. What a crazy nightmare. 
The next day, you are walking through the woods, and you see a bee.
 You are about to swat it, but it says ""Your Majesty, what are your orders?"" You freeze. It's the same bee from before. It's not a dream. It's real.  

""Um, can you hear me?"" You say. ""Yes, Your Majesty. You are hive-attuned, one of the last queens. I've come here to beg you to lead us"", she says, as she bows deeply on your shoulder. ""Lead you to what?"" I wonder out loud. ""To victory over the humans, Your Majesty. The honeyed clans cannot rule until every last human is disposed of"" ""But I am a human"", you say. ""You are the queen of the bees, Your Majesty. You must lead us to victory.""

19,2d584bbdb1634b0a91a0d271594d122a,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, we should definitely be concerned about excessive screen use at the moment. COVID is a great time for kids to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with their families. This is possibly the only time in history when this opportunity will exist, since COVID has required parents to stay home from work and work remotely on a full-time basis. Honestly, under what other circumstances could we expect to have the entire family home together for an extended period of time? There are so many parents who are able to make homemade dinners now, eat with their kids, and play family board games at night after a day of working from home, when they would really not be able to do so if they were still commuting in rush hour traffic on a daily basis going into the office. 
I think that this is a great time to take advantage of the opportunity to reconnect with our kids, and to get them off their screens fas much as possible. It'd just be so unfortunate to allow this period of time to be filled with screen time. Do we really want America's youth to just be totally dependent on their screens for entertainment, socialization and connection? It's frankly just concerning... If you've ever seen the Social Network documentary on Netflix then you know what I'm talking about. That documentary really put me on the edge of my seat, because it told the gripping story of some kids who were so sucked into their phones and social media accounts that they practically lost all sense of self and eventually even lost a grip on reality!

Moreover, screens are just inherently addictive. I know this because I'm a recovering addict myself. I have been so plugged into my phone before that I was unable to have a conversation with my own husband. That was a scary place to be, and I'm so glad that I'm not there anymore. I'm so glad that I'm able to be present with my kids, and to be able to have conversations with my husband. I would never want my kids to be in that place, and I think that it's important to be aware of the addictive nature of screens. So truly, I think that we should be worried about excessive screen use during COVID. I have friends who allow their kids to watch TV all day, and I think that's a really bad idea. My friends justify it because they say that their kids are watching educational shows. But can we really expect that kids will be able to tell the difference between educational and non-educational shows? I mean, even the supposedly educational shows are still filled with commercials for junk food and toys. And even the supposedly educational shows can still feature inappropriate content. For example, I was watching a show with my kids the other day, and I noticed that one of the characters was drinking alcohol. And that show is supposed to be educational? I just couldn't believe it.

In conclusion, kids should absolutely be off their screens during COVID. We've always been so hurried and rushed with our lives up to this point and this is a really nice chance to just level set and reset as a family without screens.

20,34cb11d1be2f4a60a350d9d5e6dc45f6,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, there is no such thing as a ""too dangerous"" sport. If you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.  All sports have risk.  Studies show that chess grandmasters have elevated blood flow and higher risk of aneurysms. You can die at any time, doing anything. It's just a matter of how much risk you are willing to accept. 

 think it's a matter of personal choice.
 If you want to climb a mountain, then climb it. If you want to jump out of a plane, then jump out of a plane. If you want to race cars, then race cars. If you want to be a stuntman, then be a stuntman. When there's enough people agreeing with you that they like it, doing an activity to warrant competitions, then we can call it a sport, as long as it doesn't harm others. 
I think that if you are willing to accept the risks, then you should be allowed to pursue your sport.
 If you remove the personal effort and risk, most sports would become nothing but people simultaneously exercising.  Risk has appeal, and the balancing of it with rewards is everything. 

People should be educated about the risks. If they choose to participate anyway, then that's their choice. Anything less takes away from their freedom.

Over time, the woman started noticing commonalities between these men she has been dating. They had a lot in common, almost too much. She of course initially wrote this off as her having a 'type', but as more time passed, it was harder to deny the common threads between all of them. 

As the woman noticed more and more, she could not help but become disillusioned and suspicious. She began to keep detailed records based on her suspicions. She didn't have any concrete theory to explain the patterns, but she knew something was amiss. 

One day she had what seemed like a crazy idea, she came up with a sort of test to prove the patterns were not the result of mere coincidence. he woman decided to take a trip to the mountains. with her dates as part of the test, and began to repeat a particular series of actions. She would observe how each man she dated reacted to this set of actions. 
The woman was surprised to find that all of her dates reacted to the same set of actions in tm similar way, perhaps even arguably, the very same way. She was certain that she had caught her dates in the act, or discovered something more inexplicable than having a ""type"". It had to be a conspiracy. 

So confounded by what to do next, the woman decided to confront her last date about it. She revealed her past experiences with the men she dated and the test she subjected them to. The man was shocked, and at first denied everything, but he was also growing desperate as his attempts never ended in success. He finally decided to admit to the woman that he was a shapeshifter, and that he was in love with her. He thought that if anything, no one would ever believe her.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude.""

Choosing depleted uranium wasn't 92's first choice of building material, nor his second, or even his third. But, after realizing that this was a material that none of his other sibling would use, he accepted this as a challenge. 

For generations, Wolf has been the enemy to the pigs and their mother. But after meeting 60 or 70 pigs, Wolf realized he could learn from their determination. Maybe he could even help them from the past mistakes of their elders. He could use his knowledge to meet their needs, and make a mutually beneficial deal. 
The wolf started to teach the pigs how to be shrewd business people. and one of those lessons came in the form of a town who had shut down its nuclear power plant decades ago.

To be fair, the house itself isn't built out of the uranium itself, but the steel containers that hold the product. The wolf and 92nd pig found out that steel containers were either thrown away, buried, or sold for scrap. These were stackable barrels that exuded a faint glow. Pigs being pigs, housekeeping wasn't always the best, yet bugs never entered 92's property.  
Choosing this material also helped 92 make a profit.
 He was provided a recycling reimbursement by the town as long as he agreed to take safety precautions when entering town. Wolf was proud of the accomplishments of his friend 92. The house he advised his friend to build will last forever and the glow of the property will always remind the town of a thrifty little pig named 92.","{'Total number of sentences': 22, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 11, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 5}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 5, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'],

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, I think that schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students with a quota restriction because they are a necessity. ads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools because they
 basic necessity. Pads and tampons are a necessity for women, especially when they experience period poverty. eriod poverty is a term used to describe the lack of access to feminine hygiene products.
 Period poverty is a real issue that affects women and girls around the world. ccording to a study by the United Nations, more than 800 million women and girls around the world lack access to feminine hygiene products.
 This is a huge problem because it can lead to health issues such as infections, reproductive tract infections and cervical cancer. It can also adversely affect the mental health of women and girls because their moods change easily during their periods. Pads and tampons are not a luxury item, they are a necessity. he United States government has already taken steps to help women and girls who experience period poverty.
 For example, the United States government has provided feminine hygiene products to women and girls in refugee camps. As a conclusion, I think that schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students with a quota restriction.

26,3cd70a8705814f8eb1344dca49679aee,"What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypical characters can be offensive. I'm sometimes offended by people who are very stereotypically gay. One example that comes to mind is the movie ""Birdcage"". The gay men in it are very over the top and very feminine. They run around screaming and acting more like women than anything. It made it hard to watch. It oddly was very highly praised when it came out which shows how people must view gay people.C
Nowadays I'm sometimes offended by how men are stereotyped. I feel that some men are portrayed as being affected by irrational emotions and prone to be abusive. This happened in that Gillete ad about toxic masculinity. I found that to be really offensive that only men can supposedly act horribly. 

I feel that stereotypes are fading somewhat over time. They are not as bad as they used to be. Women used to be portrayed as non-rational, and usually the Damsel in Distress. Now they are very tough in movies and can defend themselves. Gay men are also more shown in a positive light. You're seeing more that are depicted as masculine which I like. 

So there's times stereotypes make me cringe and even angry. I try not to let it bother me. But I'm seeing less of it in general. I just feel that everyone should be shown as a wide range of people. Every race or group has people who are strong or weak or tough or feminine. There's so much variation. You just don't want to focus on one or a very limited amount. I look forward to entertainment embracing that more going forward.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is how to interact with other people. I think that this is the most important thing because it will help them in their future. If children can learn how to interact effectively with other people, they will be able to get along with them. 

They will be able to get along with their friends and their family. They will be able to get along with their teachers and their bosses. They will be able to get along with their coworkers. They will be able to get along with their neighbors. They will be able to get along with the people they meet. 

Most of life is dealing with other people. We have interactions with people every day, and during our formative years, if we learn to make the interactions smooth, we will have an easy life. If we don't, we will have a hard life. Think of most negative actions. Murder, war, divorce, famine-how many were caused by a breakdown in communication-how many problems could we solve with better communication and empathy? 
IBy far, te most important thing I have learned in school ,ior life in general, s how to communicate with other people.
 I had a teacher who genuinely cared about her students, and emphasized really listening to each other. She taught us how to listen to each other, and how to speak in a way that would be heard. She taught us how to be respectful of each other, and how to be honest with each other. She taught us how to be empathetic towards each other, and how to be kind to each other. She taught us how to be good friends, and how to be good family members.

ow has this knowledge affected my life?
 It has made my life much better. I have learned how to communicate with other people, and I have learned how to listen to them. I avoided many problems that would have happened, had I not truly been listening. I avoided hurting people by asking myself how they would feel.   I avoided many fights by listening to what the other person was saying, and trying to understand their point of view. 

This empathetic perspective, and ability to communicate with others has served me well. I have a good job, and I am happy.  I have good friends, and I have a good family. I have a good life, and I owe it to my ability to communicate with other people.

As long as I am able to communicate with others, I will have a good life in the future. These skills are the most important thing I learned in school,  and are key to my success in life.

She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He has a huge chart at home to keep track of it. It shows all of the likes and dislikes that he has learned of hers over time. He's hoping that if he can just get the right combination, she'll love him back. 

He made himself into the perfect looking man. He had muscles and chiseled features and really should be hard to resist. But she just wasn't interested. He realized that yet again as he tried to move forward with their relationship. He just couldn't get her to love him. He decided to try something drastic that was a hail Mary move basically. He shape shifted to look exactly like her. People like themselves, right? She can't not like herself. 
He was right.
 When she saw herself she was beyond intrigued. She apparently had an interest in doppelgangers that he was not aware of. She was so into herself that she couldn't resist. She just wanted to spend time with her doppelganger. He knew enough about her to be able to pretend to be her flawlessly. 

Nothing romantic came of it. He was just happy to be with her. It was a way to do that even if it wasn't at all what he had hoped for. He would shape shift into her and basically just hang out around her apartment while pretending to be her. It was quite the unusual love story. 

Eventually she asked him to move in with her. He of course agreed. Now he was living with her, and they were spending all of their time together. He no longer had an identity of his own, even if they were just ones he had created while shape shifting. Now he was her all of the time. He was her boyfriend, at least in his head. In reality he was just a fascination for her. You can't always pick how you will be loved but you must accept it.

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. It turns out that the drug has one critical downfall. It causes the brains of those who take it to begin losing the ability to reason.

All citizens under 26 have taken the drug and slowly all begin to lose their minds. They become increasingly more violent and dangerous. When the critical side effect was realized it was too late. Too many of the population have already taken the drug and inevitably become insane and murderous. When the government realizes that they cannot save hundreds of millions, tens of millions, they decide to order a military takeover. However as the military took over, the plan backfired. Those younger and able to fight the hordes of insane were locked down. The horde wiped out more and more of humanity and the military had no solution. The military surrendered the last intact human city and those still alive.

As an 85-year-old, you were physically unfit for war against this ravenous horde. Worse yet, very few of the younger lost generation members remained. You were among the last who knew how to live normally, and among the last to remember how this was caused. Thinking back to a movie plot you vaguely remember, you had the idea of giving the horde another dose of the very drug that caused all this. Why would that work? Well it turns out, it had been done before, and an additional dose of the once miracle drug turned disaster would be fatal. In your younger days you worked on a farm and learned how to crop dust the fields. You get together with other pilots and crop dust the world dispensing another dose of the drug to the horde and eventually wipe it out.

But the bee returns, and it asks again ""What are your orders, Your Majesty?""

""Well, it can't hurt to try"" you think to yourself, and you say ""First of all, avoid all physical contact with me.""

The bee flies a few inches above you and says ""Affirmative.  How may I proceed?""

You stop to think a bit more.  You might be able to take advantage of this unlikely opportunity.
""I want you to go out and find the most beautiful flower you can find., and if you are successful, come back.""

32,495448baeef94ef2bff5fdba66f09b92,"It was an unusual morning for the people of Earth. Unbeknownst to them, all of the ""#1 Dad"" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. It seemed like an innocuous change for some, especially the dads who learned how they rank up against the other dads of the world. 
But for many, it was a bitter pill to swallow.
 Especially those that found themselves in the top 100, those that were seemingly the best of the best when it came to being a father. It was for these men that the mug changed them in a way they didn't expect. Some of them, gained an inflated ego, taking the time to gloat to the other dads whose rank was beneath them. Others were filled with jealosy and rage, unable to come to terms the fact that they weren't truly number one in the world at being a father, feeling they would be and second-rate at best. 

So forth from that day, the news found itself broadcasting crimes around the world, of the top 100 dads fighting amongst each other, arguing that they were truly better than the mugs suggested. It grew violent at times, landing many of the men in the hospital for their injuries. The weirdest occurrence however, as the media learned, was the number one rank in the world was never heard of or seen, they never made their presence known or heard. Yet, the dads never ever noticed it, they were too busy arguing with each other regarding their rank in the top 100s. What they did notice, was one day, when he irmug schanged. again. 

The news blared up to highlight the occurrence, those in the top 100s found themselves much lower ranks, reflecting their behavior in the past couple of days. Others were elated to being ranked higher than before, but their behavior never got as sour and awful as the dads that were initially seemingly ranked as the best. They were calmer, less volatile in their actions, and more mindful of what they did. However, none of the newly highly ranked dads reached the #1 position, suggesting that the previous dad that had that rank was still considered to be #1. So, the world turned its attention to finding out the best dad in the world. Months would go by, but the search would finally come to an end, being unable to find the person with the #1 mug in the world.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. 
The world is now a place where the supernatural is commonplace, and where the power of Mana can be used to create magic items, summon spirits
 and uncertainty and struggle abounds the remaining humans on the planet who have to gather and harness the mana in order to destroy their hostile alien foes. It's the only chance humanity has and fortunately it's a very good chance, especially since there is a human group called, ""Nathosilum"" who have gathered quite a bit of mana of their own as well as nurtured their magical powers to the extent of being able to kill even the most powerful aliens. 

The only problem that they have is they need to train quite a bit more fellow humans in order to overpower the aliens. And the only way to do that is to find the remaining humans who are scattered all over the world and train them. As Nathosilum goes to every continent and spreading their encoded message to all humans across the globe, more and more have risen up to the challenge. All that's left is to create plan and execute it. 

The plan is to create a magical barrier that will prevent the aliens from entering the planet and to do that they need to gather a lot humans who have the power to create shields, but before they can execute that plan, they have to kill the remaining aliens on planet Earth first which is handled by the most powerful warriors of Nathosilum. Their warriors are employed of various powers such as controlling certain elements such as water, fire, earth and air, but the most powerful of them is a warrior named, Sithilius who controls dark matter. This power of controlling dark matter is the single most power element that can be used against the aliens since these aliens are from an alternate universe that is made up of 0.00001% more dark matter than everything within our universe. That small microscopic difference is all the difference and the aliens don't know that Sithilius has that power.

Nathosilum has gathered everyone that they need and Sithilius has begun to eliminate all aliens on the planet. He's so powerful that he can concentrate his energy and manipulate all dark matter on the planet and recognize whether they're aliens are not since he can sense that tiny bit difference of dark matter that aliens have. It takes him much of his energy and concentration but within 16 hours he manages to wipe all of aliens on the planet. Then the next group of warriors create the barrier around the planet which will be permanent unless some stronger force breaks it. Sithilius reinforces the barrier with his anti-dark matter manipulations so that no alien can cross without being destroyed, and finally, Nathosilum, the magical warriors of the planet Earth, have gained their planet and freedom back!","{'Total number of sentences': 18, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 3, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 12, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 3}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 3, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(3, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (4, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call',

34,4d64b8adb8544d60beaf585c83747e97,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, people are more empathic towards their pets because they view their pets as a close member of their family, like a son, daughter, brother, sister. They are more likely to be upset by the suffering of their pet because they have a personal connection with that animal.

Where as a perfect stranger, it doesn't even have to be a tourist, just doesn't connect the same with them. 
I think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering because if we focus on animal welfare, we will forget about the hother humans, and our connection with them. 

Don't misunderstand, I think animal welfare is important but when we start putting other animals over our own kind we are doing ourselves a disservice by forgetting about the laws of math that says there is power in numbers.   

I think we should focus on animal welfare, but not at the expense of humans. Most people, I do not believe, are like this though. If a person saw a car speeding down the road and had to choose to save a kitten, or their neighbors baby toddler... I am pretty sure most people would have the moral compass enough to save the toddler, and that's how it should be. That's a close to home example though.

There are people in 3rd world nations such as north Korea that are staving to death and being beaten to death or shot, yet people would rather donate money to save the puppies instead of trying to save the staving oppressed human beings.

Animal welfare is all good, but let us not forget, we are animals too.

35,5107cf5a8ad048e99b0d92892e98d40a,"Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, it depends on what the news tells us. These days, the internet, the radio, the TV, and the newspapers are full of terrible news, unfortunately. So it depends on what, if anything, we can do about this news. I would argue that things such as COVID news are important to pay attention to, so that we can know what is safe to do and how we can protect others. Other news can be very important, but also deeply distressing to read, and knowing the information doesn't actually allow us to help other people. When it becomes important is when it comes to what we share, and how we participate civically.

There is so much misinformation out there, that we should be informed when we choose to share a fact or opinion. That is the least we can do. Plus, if we see a dubious-looking claim, it is up to us to get the correct information and correct the person. Furthermore, when it comes time to go into a voting booth, we need to be filled with good, true information.
There are cases where we would be bad citizens if we aren't up to date on world happenings.
 Especially if we're an undecided voter, or if there's a crisis unfolding where we can personally have a true impact. Don't get me wrong, it's generally important to be up to date on what is happening in the world. But for the sake of our own mental state, it can be helpful to filter what we take in. Do we need to know the latest guidelines from the CDC? 100%. Do we need to know the details of a presidential summit in Europe? Less so. Once again, this is good information to know, but there is so much news out there that we not only should not be expected to always be completely on top of it, but we also should feel free to not absorb every morsel of it.
People think that if they don't keep up with the news, then other people will think less of them.
 But I think the issue lies more with making sure to get correct and complete information before forming an opinion, and living your life based upon truth. As long as I have knowledgeable opinions based on objective facts, I will be able to participate in a democracy, I will be able to advocate for what I believe in, and I will be able to contribute to my society. 

Another situation where it is indeed important to be up to date on the news is when it comes to having perspective. Realizing where one stands in the world. For example, recent news from Afghanistan should cause people to feel strong empathy for the people there, and recognize their privilege, if not there, to be living in a place that is not under Taliban rule. One need not necessarily pore over every detail, but we should be informed enough to be compassionate.

In conclusion, we don't need every bit of news out there. And we need to filter what we take in, making sure to only draw from reliable sources. But we can also accept how overwhelming the 24-hour news cycle can be, and realize that we don't need to know every single thing that's happening. We can still be well informed, without being exhausted. Just make sure you always have a grip on reality, and are well informed on what matters for you to be a good citizen.","{'Total number of sentences': 36, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 26, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 2}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (25, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (31, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (32, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (34, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (35, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (36, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user', 'empty-call'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user', 'empty-call'], 25: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user'], 31: ['user'], 32: ['user'], 33: ['user'], 34: ['user'], 35: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 36: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 36'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 13 edges,10,13," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call'"

37,547fa8cbc3294669b00903779ce63e9d,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, I think that some people are more empathic towards the suffering of animals because most people have pets, and because of that they put into their imaginations that the suffering of an animal they see on TV, or where ever else, as though it could be happening to their pet. 

As far as tourists suffering goes, as a former tourist myself, people in a foreign land are interested in the tourist but do not really seem to care that much. Maybe even because of human prejudice. They do not see others who are not related to them in some way as inferior.

Many people forget that humans are animals also, so in a way humans can fall under animal suffering as well. So yes, it is wrong to focus on animal welfare while ignoring human welfare.
I think that people should focus on both to be honest. It is wrong to treat an animal badly, but it is also just as wrong to treat a person badly also. Animals and Humans are living things and to abuse them in any way is a bad thing. 

Some people focus on animal welfare also because it gives them a sense of being better than other, and they view it as humans fault that animals are suffering.","{'Total number of sentences': 16, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 2}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 2, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (12, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 12: ['user', 'empty-call'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 16: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 16'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) )",DiGraph with 14 nodes and 16 edges,4,11," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we all do have a responsibility to keep up with what is going on. I think lack of knowledge leads to ignorance and the inability to make reasonable arguments and rationale choices based on facts. The most recent presidential election and the situation in Afghanistan are two news items I can use as examples. Keeping up with the news is not only important for local and national events, but also in a global sense.

he most recent presidential election is a good example of how lack of knowledge can lead to poor choices.
  There were already so many lies being propagated by the Republican party, and Trump in particular, that those who did not keep up with current events were in more in the dark. I think it was imperative for everyone to understand what the issues facing the country were, how each candidate was going to solve those issues, and the lies each candidate may or may not have told.  Too many people simply chose ignorance of the aforementioned and voted along party lines. I think people are obligated to understand what really goes on in their country, and the best way to do that is to keep up with the news. Whether on TV, the radio, or online, there are multiple avenues to get news. It is up to the individual to seek it out, but the news is there.

World events also have an effect on our country. They can impact trade, safety, and immigration issues. Unless each person has family members in foreign nations, the news is the simplest way to see what is happening. Again, it is a deterrent of ignorance.  I personally have been so tired of hearing about COVID, I haven't watched the news for weeks.  A couple of days ago, my daughter asked me to explain why the situation in Afghanistan was happening, and I didn't even know what she was talking about. Ignorance isn't bliss, it is ignorance. To be educated, and to educate our children on events, we all need to watch the news.  Informed people make better informed choices and don't perpetuate lies about the world and life.
I think the news is important, but Iin that respect, you can't think the news is fake. These people went to college and worked hard for their degrees and to have journalistic integrity. To say they are basically liars, is cruel and bullying. We cannot allow that type of language to continue without being checked immediately if we are to be certain people believe what they hear or read in the news. Keeping up with events is important for being more educated people.","{'Total number of sentences': 30, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 21, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 3}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 3, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 0}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user', 'empty-call'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 30'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3' ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 11 nodes and 11 edges,22,22," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call'"
39,5caae848f6e048e2bc791363cc27eb30,"Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is every bit, if not better than reading an actual book for many reasons. he first and most obvious is that listening to audiobooks generally requires less attention.
 I don't know about everyone else, but as far as I'm concerned, reading lines on a page can make my eyes tired and my mind wander. When I listen to an audiobook, my focus doesn't have to be so strained that I can't keep it. In other words, I remember what I've listened to better than what I have read. I'm sure if I feel this way there are countless others who agree and also benefit from audiobook listening. 

Another benefit to listening to an audiobook is its portability. I can pick up nearly ANYWHERE and listen. I don't have to worry about getting the pages of a book dirty if I'm outside. Also by listening I can multi-task, such as keep the book on in the background while I am doing other things. Taking an afternoon walk while listening to a book is actually a delightful activity. 

Another obvious benefit of audiobooks to many is the increased accessibility for the vision impaired. Books in braille can be expensive, but now people can find nearly any book in an audio version and listen to it.    

My final major point is that sometimes it's just easier to listen to a story. Sometimes at the end of a long, hard day I want more than anything to relax. Audiobooks allow me to enjoy the experience of a book without having to exert the energy of holding a book up or strain my eyes that are tired from looking at a screen all day. All in all there so many benefits of listening to audiobooks that it is just as good, if not better than reading an actual book.","{'Total number of sentences': 23, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 11, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 5}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 5, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 2}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3'], dtype='<U11')), (13, array(['empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3'], 13: ['empty-call', 'user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 23'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( 'prompt', 'empty-call' ) ), +( 'user', X( tau, ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ) ) ) )",DiGraph with 13 nodes and 14 edges,44,34," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between the action 'prompt', the action 'empty-call' and  in parallel with the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action,  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3'"
40,5cb5a5445f3a4e82af6dcd70d4019ba6,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, Schools should not provide period products. This is the responsibility of the parents. Budgeting for products like pads and tampons is different from budgeting for toilet paper, soap and other products. Pad and tampons are products related to the reproductive cycle. They are tied to things such as puberty and fertility. That makes them a sensitive issue, especially among students.  
I believe that parents should supply students with period products.
 Parents don't want schools to teach their children about morality and controversial reproductive issues, therefore, they need to provide the products they want for their children.  Tampons are like deodorant. If you teach your kid that the aluminum in deodorant is causing health issues,  you should provide the product that you want your kids to use, yourself. 

eriod products are not expensive for women and it is a personal issue.
   As a product some people may also be sensitive to it. Some people may need custom products because of allergies. Once schools open the door to being the provider of these products, they also become responsible for custom items. 

Parents are the ultimate guardians of their children, and should be teaching their children about the fundamentals of their reproductive cycle.   Schools should not have to be held responsible for a product that is so sensitive. I believe this is an issue solely for parents and their children.  Schools should focus on learning, with perhaps a small supply of products for emergencies only.

You start to feel strange prickles on your skin. You look at your arms and see tiny bee hairs coming out of your skin in the colors of black and yellow. You start to panic and scream. You feel pain on the tips of your shoulder blades. Two giant wings burst out of your back and you scream even louder. The wings are dark brown with yellow stripes. You can't control them and you flail about.

""Slowly, your majesty!"" the bee on your shoulder chirps. ""You mustn't strain your new wings!""
""I can't control them!"" you yell.

You flail about some more and feel a sharp pain oi your back.
 You turn around and see a pair of stingers, like those of a bee, sticking out your back. You feel a tickle on your face and start flailing again. Two antennae burst from your forehead. 
You see your hands, which have gained a kind of bee-pollen fuzz.
 You look at your chest and you start to see a faint black-and-yellow striped pattern. You look down at your feet and see that they've turned into bee's feet, complete with the two little hooks for climbing.

""I'm a bee?!"" you yell.
 
""A bee-human hybrid, yes.
"" The bee says calmly. ""You are queen of the bees, and you will live out your days here in this hive."" She points to a giant castle made of honeycomb in the distance. ""You will live here with your subjects, and you will never be alone.""

This is agony. You hate it. You begin trying to rip your wings out and when you cry, only honey comes from your eyes. This is some sort of horror story. You feel a sharp pain in your forearm.

They learn that the other nations of the world have far outstripped the U.S. in technology, due to their isolation and lack
 of restrictions on scientific research. The U.S. has been set back to the position of most technologically backward nation in the world. s the U.S. struggles to re-enter international politics, they must also combat a new threat that threatens humanity: an unknown
 force from deep space that could bring about the end of all things.

nd so the world's nations are forced to face their most daunting challenge yet: A common enemy that could destroy them all.
 It began as a simple research project on a distant planet. Within three hours, of a meteor storm striking the surface of that planet, the researchers were dead. In the midst of that chaos, something emerged from the ruins and began building structures out of rock. 
It was a golem, made of living stone.
 It was intelligent and possessed an almost reptilian cunning, but there were mysteries about it. It healed from injuries quickly and could seemingly reshape itself. Within a few months it had built an entire city. As more and more of them appeared, some even developed the ability to fly. 

The golems were hostile, and within months they began attacking human and alien settlements in distant star systems. They struck with great savagery and yet seemed to lack any real tactics or strategy. Worse, they had no regard for losses on their own side. All of these things suggested that the golems could not be reasoned with, and would have to be destroyed. 

Mankind's initial efforts to destroy the golems involved a variety of nuclear weapons, but those attacks only made the golems grow more. They reacted to the threat by forming a powerful shield around their cities, which repelled all ordnance, and then they counter-attacked with the most devastating weapon imaginable: A barrage of meteorites. 
Within a matter of weeks, tManyrplanets were educed to an apocalyptic wasteland.
 The golems cut a deadly path through the system. They destroyed every human and alien settlement they encountered. And now, they are headed to Earth! 
It is now up to the combined forces of the world's militaries to put an end to this threat once and for all.
 Can the United States help create a counter to this new threat?  Will we be able to put aside our differences in time?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, we shouldn't care or try to keep up with the news. There are so many sources of fake news, that we would waste valuable time.  We're not able to make any meaningful changes, even if we do pay attention to the news.  All it does is cause extra stress and worry. 

Instead, we should focus on bettering ourselves. We should focus on our families, friends, and communities. We should focus on our own personal growth.  Reading the news once or twice a week is fine. But, if you're reading it every day, you're wasting your time. 

Most news doesn't help us.  Celebrity News is popular, but has detrimental effect on most people who read it.  Reading about Meghan's new $10 million Necklace,  Jane Fonda's new 250k health spa treatment, or Chris Hemsworth's new $50 mansion only leads us to dissatisfaction. e should focus on our own lives, and not worry about what the Kardashians are doing.


We hear about school shootings, building collapses, and the media milks it for everything it can. t's not our fault that these things happen, and we can't do anything about it. on a national scale. We are being used, as consumers of sensational tragedies to line the Murdoch's pockets. 

New stations often make no effort to conceal their bias. We pick someone who agrees with us, and the news becomes an echo chamber of our positions, stifling growth and innovation. 

What we can do, is occasionally read world news, but focus locally. We can raise good children. e can volunteer at our local schools., churches, and organizations.  We can focus on our neighborhoods and friends. By doing this, we keep up with the news that really matters, and stay informed about our community, things that we can actually change.","{'Total number of sentences': 29, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 17, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 6}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 14, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 6, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 8, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'],

Some mugs have no ranks at all for the dads that were rated unsatisfactory. Everyone is upset. It's all over the news. The government is involved. People are storming the Capital in protest. There is panic in the streets. People want justice restored. The people want every dad to be #1. 

The CEO of the mug company stands his ground. A reporter asks him why he can't just change the mugs back to where they were. ""I can't keep living a lie. Not every dad is #1. In fact, there can only be one number one. The only way to know who that really is, is to rate every dad. So that's what I did. I'm just being honest."" 
The reporter then asks him what he is going to do about the people protesting outside.
 ""I would suggest meditation and deep breathing. That should help them resolve their feelings about the kind of parents they are."" 
The CEO then says, ""I think I'm going to go home and visit my dad.""
 The reporter asks, ""And where does your dad rank on the list of dads?""

""Oh, he's 7,345. We have some issues to work out. But don't worry, he still gets a mug."" The reporter shook her head. ""I noticed you have a mug there yourself."" 
""Yes, I am #3,982.""


""But you don't have any children. So why do you have a dad mug at all?"" 

""I will be someday. And I don't have high expectations for myself, let's be real."" The story aired on the news that night. The CEO of the mug company was available for comments.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""dude."" 
he 92nd little pig said, ""I'm not afraid of you."" My name is Felicia Squiggletail the 5th, and you're not allowed in this house!""
he wolf said, ""I'm going to huff and puff and blow your house in., and then eat your for dinner!"" TFeldcia laughed ""I don't think so, wolf.
 Wait one minute, and then I'll come outside."" 
The wolf agreed, thinking about the foolish pig, and how he was going to have a free meal. 
When the wolf was waiting, Felicia called the 92nd little pig's friends, the 91st little pig and the 90th little pig
. Though the wolf should have known that she was an amazing chemist and creator of gadgets because of how she safely built her house from uranium, Felicia possessed mechanical skills that would literally blow him away.  

In her spare time, Felicia had thought about how to appropriately punish the evil wolf for eating her brothers and sisters. She had developed 3 very large fans, mounted on the front of rocket packs. The current from the fans could pick up large objects, like a wolf, while the rocket packs would let the pigs hover safely out of his reach.  91 and 90 each had a set, just like her. 

The wolf heard a noise in the distance. It was the 90th and 91st pig coming. He smelled them, and was very angry; he was going to eat them too! he wolf was so angry, he forgot about Felicia.
 She came out of the house, rocket pack on, and turned on the fans. The wolf was picked up, and the pigs flew away to the river nearby,, wolf trapped in the 3 gushing streams of air. The wolf tried to bite the pigs, but they were too high up. The wolf tried to jump up, but he was too heavy.  They carried him to the river, and then dropped the wolf in it. The wolf was very angry, but he couldn't do anything. 

""If you ever come back, my robots are programmed to do this to you, as many times as needed!"" warned Felicia.

Flower shops are bringing in lots of money from all the dads buying flowers for their wives. 
The dads are all in a frenzy.
 They all want to be #1. There are rumors about the top candidates for the winning spot. There's Mister Jones, from the county seat. He's a lawyer, and he's a good dad. His contender and neighbor, Mister Smith, is a doctor. He is also a good dad too. What numbers will they get when the mugs arrive? 

The morning of the big day finally arrives. It's Father's Day. The dads are all up early. They wait eagerly for their mugs to be delivered to their doorsteps. They are all anxious to see what the mugs will say. They wait and they wait.  Minutes turn into hours. No sign of the mugs. 
The dads are getting worried.

The next day, the news was all about the rankings.
 Who changed all the mugs? It was a mystery. Studies and investigations began. People began to worry that this was some sort of sign, like impending doom. 
The next day, all of the ""#1 Mom"" mugs changed to show the actual ranking of Moms.
 People began to panic. This was proof that someone was paying attention to everything we do. This was not good. 
The next day, all of the ""#1 Grandpa"" mugs changed to show the actual ranking of Grandpas.
 More evidence that we were being watched, and that there was indeed a lot of judgement going on, behind the scenes. The implications of this were such, that people began to analyze their own behavior.

People weren't analyzing their behavior, when they were out in public and others could see them. They had already analyzed that to death. People were starting to analyze the behavior they only exhibit when they believe themselves to be alone. This behavior was far too often embarrassing, and this new revelation, that someone is watching and judging, was very scary.

People began doing things differently. Suddenly, just as suddenly as the Dad mugs had changed, food pantries filled with the best tasting foods. Shortly thereafter, a new policy came out of the Airbnb community. They would no longer be charging people who wish to stay in their extra houses. No more homelessness. Sexual assaults and violent crimes were wiped out, overnight. Yet, nothing on the surface of people's behavior had changed.

People were their same old selves, out in public. What had changed was what they did in the shadows. They were being their best selves, in the shadows. They were being as decent when they were alone, as they would tend to be out in public. That made a big enough difference to change the world.

A new holiday was declared, the world over. Mug day was to celebrate the day when everything changed. People prayed to the cosmic entity that had changed all the mugs. There was a new god in town, and his name was Mug. Mug the magnificent they called this new deity. 
Mug was pleased.

48,748af209d9014eeb9a66146e3db9a1d3,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, you have to look at each sport individually and decide if it is too risky based on where you are in your life. Younger people who are single and have no children may be willing to take on a greater level of risk than another person who is older and more established.However, I know some very good athletes in their 50s and 60s who are still climbing in places like Yosemite and the Coast Range.
 They decided for themselves that being more active is a risk they are willing to take. 

I feel that younger people are less likely to be judged as selfish for pursuing these more dangerous activities. When you get out of your mid-20s and reach your 30s and beyond, you start to get some looks. However, people who are teenaged to 20 something tend to be able to do whatever without any issues. They could play dangerous sports, participate in Nascar or anything in between. 
It also depends on where you live.
 If you are doing an extreme sport that is not common in your area then people will be more likely to judge you. But if you are doing one that is very common then that is the norm of where you live. It just goes to show the extent of how many variables play into this argument. erception is everything when it comes to being labeled as selfish for our pursuits.
 It really comes down to what is considered acceptable on a society level as well as a local level. 

So it it selfish to participate in extreme sports? I would have to say not necessarily. There are too many factors that can come into play to be able to say what is or is not selfish. I believe that each individual has to look at the level of risk they are willing to endure and do what they feel is right for them. They just have to be prepared for others to potentially judge them for their actions.

In my opinion,
A lot of students work while in college. College athletes usually don't have the time to attend their classes, do their studies, have a job AND dedicate hours of mental and physical labor towards their sport. For that reason alone, there should be some time of stipend or pay. 

The argument that it would distort the economics of the college sport is assuming that the pay would be close to pro-sports levels of pay. The point of paying athletes is not to make them professional athletes–it is merely to pay them for their work, dedication, and commitment so they can continue to attend school for a degree while potentially earning a spot in pro levels of their sport of choice. 

There is an amount of money between zero and millions. How much does the average college student make at their part or full time job? How many hours are they working? What are the costs of the town they live in? It doesn't have to be the minimum wage equivalent, but why not provide some support?

If you have a 19 year old who is smart, athletically talented, with an average family and income and attending university on a sports scholarship what happens when they flunk out towards the end of their sophomore year because they were so exhausted from their team practice, drills, watching tape, fundraisers and other athletic activities on top of their 20 hour a week job needed to pay for gas and transport, that they fell behind in a class or 2. Don't they deserve a little extra help?

In my opinion, college athletes should not be paid for their participation in sports because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Let's say a school has a great physics department that draws a lot of applicants and earns the school credibility that ultimately helps their bottom line. It's not as if those students are paid a million dollars to go to school. Going to college should be about getting an education. It should not be about making money. 
CAnother reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would take away the fun in college sports because the richest schools could simply bid higher for the best players. It isn't much of a competition between teams when the amount of money they have has a direct effect on how good of a team they can afford. This would likely, over time erode the quality of sports teams of the smaller schools, and even the economics of the schools themselves. 

The third and most important reason college athletes shouldn't be paid is that it would change the nature of college sports. I've always personally found it more exciting to watch college sports than pro sports because I know the athletes are doing it for the love of the game and are maybe even more passionate about it. 

All in all I think it wold be best for college athletes to not be paid because it would change the nature of college sports and take away the fun of it.","{'Total number of sentences': 20, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 5, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 4}","[(9, array(['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9'))]","{9: ['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['gpt3-call']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 9'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 20'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), X( tau, *( 'user', 'empty-call' ) ) )",DiGraph with 13 nodes and 14 edges,45,9," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions the action 'user', the action 'empty-call', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"
51,780c48b1977548dfa5e66adf6b2f9d51,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, screens are the end of meaningful human relationships. 

Whatever happened to just relaxing with friends, having a meal or actually talking? I feel like I am surrounded by robots; people who can still hear but can’t actually engage with the person they are sitting in front of.

What happens where two people are communicating, face-to-face? You feel the adrenaline from the situation; you feel human. You both process a host of visual, tactile, olfactory and other cues that we have evolved over millions of years to appreciate and understand. You might even notice the subtlety of another person’s breathing change, the difference in their skin where they broke their collar bone once and that has not fully healed.
When you have a screen between you, you can’t see any of this.
 In fact, if you've ever had the experience of finally meeting in real life a person you have digitally interacted with on many occasions, you probably have been struck by how little the person in front of you has to do with the mental construct you have formed from those digital sessions.
As screen time increases, people are disengaging from their loved ones and their communities.
 An app-mediated interaction is a pale shadow of what can transpire in even a 60-second meeting. Facebook ""friends"" have almost nothing to do with real friendship: they can be the result of real friendship, but are almost never the cause.

The more we screen, the less we actually communicate.  And the less we communicate, the fewer common values and ideas we share, and the more alienated we become from each other. 

And here's the thing. The less we communicate with each other, the more we are opening the door to a host of new digital communicable diseases: trolling, hacking, gaslighting, rumor-spreading, fake news, and much more. The more we self-separate, the more we simmer in our own heat and stew in our own toxicity with which we can digitally infect others.

I’m sure the next pandemic we face will be in some way digitally transmitted. Maybe it already has begun.

52,7b2aaf58f55a434f91bb71515a329f13,"How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology has made romantic interactions better and has improved the dating scene. Just take technology out of the equation for a second. No phones, no internet. How do you keep in touch with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you're not living in the same area? You would have to drive just to have simple communication with them.   And you can't spend all your time in a car. The gas prices alone would cost you a fortune.

Luckily for us, technology has helped the dating scene. We are able to communicate via phone call, text, FaceTime, etc. There is also dating apps that can even help us meet the man or woman of our dreams. 

Technology has made it much easier to break the ice. It has made it easier to keep long distance relationships happy and healthy. I have used Tinder in the past and it takes a lot of the stress and anxiety out of the beginning stages of dating.

You simply swipe in one direction if you're interested in the person in the picture and swipe the other way if you're not. 

Technology can also allow couples to bond using an app like Netflix. Think of how many shows on Netflix have been appointment viewing for couples. Stranger Things and Outer Banks come to mind right away. Technology also allows us to take photos and videos of our experiences with our significant other which can create memories that last forever. Without those pictures and videos all we really can rely on is our memory.

In general, I believe that technology has had a very positive effect on dating and relationships. It has made dating much easier and has helped relationships become stronger and more enjoyable for the people involved.","{'Total number of sentences': 29, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 19, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 1}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 1, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(9, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{9: ['prompt', 'user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 9'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 29'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( 'prompt', 'gpt3-call' ) ), 'user' )",DiGraph with 7 nodes and 6 edges,19,49," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between the action 'prompt', the action 'gpt3-call' and the action 'user'"

Dads everywhere are speaking to the good Lord about how things can be changed and how he can help them with their respective families.  Doctors are flooded with requests for anti-anxiety meds and tranquilizers.

Big business is getting in on this too.  Many have announced Dad Bring Your Kids to Work Day, others have changed policy around family leave for dads and not a few are touting changes favoring work-life balance.   Mny businesses are paying men to stay at home. with children under school age

Suddenly, he's gone, and someone else is speaking. ""Barack, it's John F. Kennedy.""

 I want you to go to a gun store and buy a gun. Then, I want you to go to a shooting range and learn how to use it. Then call me back.

JFK

So you go to the nearest gun store, and buy a Glock, and fill out the paperwork while the secret service detail rolls their eyes, and the gun store owner smirks. You also buy a box of ammunition, and luckily there's a range attached to the gun store, so you put in a pretty good day of shooting, and practicing.

Then, you get another letter.  ""Now, I want you to go to the White House, and kill everyone in the Oval Office."" ""But that's just Joe Biden, and maybe that ugly woman who's vice president."" ""I know."" says the voice.

In my opinion, its the stereotypical, dumb blonde that really cheeses my grits. Its just pure nonsense. I mean, I have a friend who is a blonde and she is the smartest person I know. That right there should tell you something. It hurts all other blond women.  Whether people realize it or not they may view blonds in a more negative light compared to other hair colors. Its been going on for as long as I can remember, especially in the 80's and 90's. It appears to have eased up a bit but I still hear it or see it on a regular basis. My generation will always be plagued by it. A large portion of us will forever see blonds as a little dumber then the rest because we were conditioned that way. I'm not saying that all blondes are smart either, but what I am saying is that the stereotype is very real and it hurts. I bet it has even effected their pay over the years. I'm assuming countless girls have been teased about it all their lives. I'm sure it has effected their self esteem and confidence especially in the work place. Its a stereotype I would like to see disappear because we are all dumb when it comes to most things in life.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.

hi Mana Knights, have risen a group of people with the ability to wield Mana, and the fight to reclaim
 the world. They have a cathedral on the Pacific coast, where all four winds blow each day. Mana is attracted here, as a nexus of their power. 
The Mana Knights have a special relationship with the Mana Goddess.
 They are the only ones who can hear her voice. She is the one who gives them their power, and she is the one who decides who will be a Mana Knight. 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to cast spells, which are called ""Mana Arts"".
 These spells are based on the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. 
Mana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor.
 These items are called ""Mana Tools"" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called ""Mana Shields"". 
Mana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others.
 They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. 
The Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight.
 The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  

You have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. Earth is the element of strength and power.
  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.  Fire is quick and energetic. You can see yourself in each element. 

You must dedicate one element as your specialty. How will you ever choose one?

You're shocked. This has to be a joke. JFK has been dead for ages. There is even a video of him getting shot in the head. Surely you are just being trolled by someone. At the end of the day, your curiosity gets the best of you.

You call the number and a man picks up. You tell him that you're Barack Obama and got the letter that was sent and marked by a JFK. The man tells you to hold on and transfers you to another line.

You hear a man pick up and he claims that he is John F. Kennedy. You tell him that's impossible and that JFK has been dead for decades. He explains that he has been alive the entire time and wanted to get out of the limelight. The entire assassination was staged similar to a movie.

JFK used a stunt double and effects to make it look real. You sit there and tell JFK you want proof. He sends you a picture of his license as well as pictures from his past in his wallet. He also shows you his new license that has a fake name on it as well.

You sit there shocked and have no idea how to react. JFK tells you that he has a job for you and that you will be paid handsomely. He tells you to pack your bags and that you will be picked up in a few hours.

A few hours later you are picked up and are going to a unknown destination. You sit in the car and the man driving tells you that you will be working with JFK. You ask him what the job is and he tells you that you will be working with JFK to help him take down the Illuminati.

You ask JFK what the issue with the Illuminati is. He tells you that they are a group of people who control the world and have been doing so for centuries. They are a group of people who control the world's money supply and are very rich. 
He tells you that he wants to take them down and that he needs your help.
 You tell JFK that you would love to help but don't know where to start. JFK tells you that he has a plan and that he will explain it to you on the way. He explains that you that he is going to infiltrate the Illumanti and destroy them from the inside. His new alias is the 3rd richest person in the world.

You are shocked at this information as well and get uncomfortable. You tell JFK that you're too afraid to help and want to go back to your wife and children. JFK gets very upset and tells you that you clearly don't care about your country. You go back home and are confident that you made the right decision. While you value your country, there is too many things that could go wrong and harm you or your family.

Of course, you are not affected directly by the drug's side effects, since you were too old to receive the drug at the age of 28 many years ago. However, you now see that catastrophe has struck your children, because they all received the drug. Your children are now living in a world where they are all immortal, but they are all sterile. The world's population had been falling ever since the first drugs were administered but no one could really pinpoint the reason before. Now, it is obvious. All the blame had previously been pointed at various sources like the environment, or global warming, or women's rising career ambitions, or unfriendly work from home policies for new parents. But now, it is clear that the real culprit was the drug. The drug explains why the population has been dwindling because slowly but surely, it has been killing women's reproductive organs over the last 50 years.  The effects were not necessarily immediate but more felt over the course of generations, and now, the latest group of women to come into childbearing age are 100% barren. You are completely shocked that the government could have been so reckless as to make everyone get the drug.  The women who are unable to have children are very upset. They are angry at the government for making them get the drug, and they are angry at the scientists for creating the drug in the first place. They feel that they can no longer be defined as ""real women"" without the capacity to bear children and become mothers. They feel that their lives are not worth living anymore. One woman, Soeurette Morley, decides to go on a rampage against the government by creating her own counterdrug. She is able to create a drug that reverses the effects of the original drug. She is able to reverse the sterilization effects of the original drug, but she is unable to reverse the aging effects. As a result, everyone who she administers the counterdrug to rapidly ages to become their real, true age. This means that women who had become very accustomed to looking perpetually 28 now look 75. They are devastated because their husbands still look 28 and now they feel like cougars. The men are devastated because their wives look like their grandmothers. However, this counterdrug is what the world needs to start creating babies again. The world is now in a race to create a new generation of babies. Men and women couple off immediately. Women who had been barren for decades are now able to conceive. The world is in a frenzy of baby making. And the world succeeds in this mission.

59,89636fe51d724f15a23f1cef4124191f,"How Worried Should We Be About Screen Time During the Pandemic?

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, the best things that humans do is adapt. This, I feel, is just another step in our evolution.  e are now in a time where we have to adapt to the digital world.
 It was going to happen at some point in time. It's just that COVID-19 really sped up the process to an almost all digital screen time.
I personally think that we should embrace the digital world and use it to our advantage.
 I think we are, for the most part, also safer that way at the same time. Not to mention , we can now connect with people from all over the world much easier than we really tried to before hand. That has it's own benefits in itself. 

It allows us to better self manage our own lives as well, if we have the privilege's of being able to work from home. Examples would be , being able to take care of our children, or even just being able to work from home and not have to worry about the commute, and less stress and pressure from the work place.

We had already started to go in this direction of a lot of screen time, except nobody really thought about it. It was just a natural progression of the digital age. Like I said before though, it helps to keep us safe from the harsh realities of things like pandemics. 

I think people should embrace this next step in our evolution, instead of condemning it, because it was already starting to happen. Almost everyone carried around a screen (smartphone) in their pockets that they always were looking at anyways on the outside. So what is the difference if we are using it inside our homes more often. 
We are already in a time where we are more connected to each other than ever before.

She decides to tell him that she knows he is a shapeshifter. He is shocked. This is the first time she has figured it out, and he's worried that this will be the end of their relationship. She says that she found out recently, having seen him do it one day when he thought she wasn't around. 
She says that she doesn't mind.
 It will keep things from getting boring as she can sleep with any celebrity that she wants with his power. He feels a little hurt. He hadn't expected her to want to use him in such a way. Maybe he didn't really know her as well as he had thought.

62,8c884bfc6cad45cf9b9609a7acbb0bf7,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports, and cross the line. 

 believe that the line between what is reasonable and what is not should be drawn at the point where the risk of death or serious injury becomes
 too great. With mountain climbing, an estimated 7000 people die every year, and many more are seriously injured.  Compare this with Football,  where less than 30 on average die each year. .  With some extreme sports such as base jumping, the fatalities are even higher: some reports say that 1 in 60 dies. 
The reason that I believe that extreme sports are too dangerous to be called sports is because they are not safe. for even trained athletes.  xtreme sports are nofteo nt regulated., and encourage too high of a risk. 

Extreme sports affect future generations. Our children see extreme sports, and think this behavior is fine. They see the glory and fame that extreme sports bring, and think that this risky behavior is what they should be doing. 
Extreme sports affect the economy.
 Extreme sports are the cause of many expensive injuries. People place an unneeded burden on the healthcare system, for their own selfish reasons.  How many people have been delayed needed surgeries because the latest daredevil was jumping over 30 motorcycles, or broke a rib trying the newest stunt? 

Extreme sports also affect the environment. They bring people to pristine areas, lugging heavy plastic waste that is often discarded.  The trash pile on Mount Everest is a good example of this.

No, Extreme sports are not sports in the traditional sense, and should not be called sports. They are nothing more than selfish, risk-seeking behavior.

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, I think we should absolutely embrace our devices in all their glory and accept that it will only increase in the future.  find it's easier to just get over the ""blame the screen"" sentiment and embrace it for what it is - a new phase
 in human social evolution. Sure, screen time may come with its own set of problems, but those problems will be solvable as we gain new technology and new insights into our psychology. 
ure, we haven't yet adapted effectively to this new way of social interaction, bwe are still in its teenage years. You can tell by all the irrationality going on but we will figure out ways to overcome this as well. The ones who are ruining it all are the ones who grew up before the internet. They are the ones that cannot figure out what information is good or bad. The younger generations have more in common and have a better understanding of how to navigate through all the nonsense. They will be the ones who will fully realize what this new technology can do. They will be the ones living in virtual reality, creating whole universes to work, learn and play. They will be the ones to make this technology mature and never question it like we do. 
e are all teechnically tchnology, humans are nothing more than biological technology - devices engineered to collect information, process it and send it out.
 Our devices just make everything much easier and more productive. So I say totally embrace the use of screen time, use them as much as possible. Get ready for a future that is even more immersive and plugged in. That is where we are and that is where we are heading.

66,90f6335118ab4f52b0db9c5ca271d4d2,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

Schools should provide resources and relevant items to its students, given that many might come from families that cannot afford such luxuries. Schools providing free pads and tampons is a critical action that helps female students, who naturally as they grow up experience puberty and menstrual cycles. This is a natural process that should not be shamed or hidden, and resources should be given to help female students understand the changes occurring to their body.  Offering free pads or tampons is of little cost to the schools, much less costlier than other initiatives it may undertake, but its benefit is significant for students that come from low-income families, or who might be unfamiliar with such items. Like toiletries and other sundries, pads and tampons are hygienic items that help female students feel more comfortable in their bodies, and more in control during their menstrual cycles. Like Band-Aids, they offer help to female students, and are critically needed to avoid outcomes that they rather avoid, such as staining their clothes. 

Naturally, their is a sense of privacy and urgency related to tampons and pads, given that unlike Band-Aids or similar items, many female students do not want others to know that they requested such items from the school. Therefore, schools should take heed and use caution when giving such items, doing so in a private and respectful way, that does not disclose the identity of the female students requesting such items, and maintains their anonymity. Failure to do so can lead to bullying, that shames such students for having a natural bodily process, and for essentially struggling to not afford such items. The end effects of such bullying would then be detrimental to the student, and could lead to negative outcomes, such as a decline in mental health, and a notable decrease in acadmic performance. Schools should essentially be safe havens for students to learn and acquire skills and knowledge to better prepare themselves for the future. They also serve as ways to socialize, and learn how to cooperate and engage with others. Therefore, schools should be places where students feel comfortable and safe, and should not be places where students are shamed for having a natural bodily process. Schools should ultimately provide them with the items and resources they lack for whatever reason that may be, including pads and tampons in a private and respectful manner.","{'Total number of sentences': 20, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 10, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 3}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 8, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 3, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (10, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 10: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 20: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 20'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) )",DiGraph with 14 nodes and 16 edges,4,11," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, many of the subjects in school are not directly related to someones life. I would look at high school more of a way to prepare young adults for their future and life on their own as opposed to preparing them for college. All the more advanced types of maths and sciences arent all that beneficial to many of the lives of students, especially those who plan on working after graduation. The classes i feel should be implemented more often stem around life skills, and mental health. I believe there should be an entire class on finances in my opinion. An entire marking period or semester spent on credit, one spent on investing and saving, one spent on debt and saving, etc. Just more life skills over the general education types of courses. Not only this but i think nutrition should be taught in a much more in depth way. I think itd be a great idea to teach about foods as a way to heal your body, like medicine. This can tie into mental health. Instead of looking for drugs to feel better and less anxious, how about trying some magnesium. Maybe eating a higher fat diet will slow your mind down anxiety wise, eating more pastured eggs, or nutritious foods like raw milk, organ meats, fatty fish, etc. The most important thing i learned in school personally had nothing to do with any of my classes. The thing i learned was simply about myself and how i interact with other people. I was often uncomfortable in school because i was being forced to act a certain way in a classroom full of kids. I learned that i was insecure in certain ways, and confident in certain ways. It helped my future because i knew where i needed to grow personally, and i realized what i could do to help myself through my own research. I think the best thing about school is the environment, and the helpful people you meet and can learn from.   I think the worst things are the forced agenda, the tests and the stress involved with all of it. The school system is very structured and for people who are outliers and different it can really harm their minds. I grew up with ADHD, so i always viewed this as a crutch growing through school because i was different and disabilitied in that environment.  I now view it as an asset as i am able to focus on what i am interested in much more than the average person, and this allows me to become great at different things i set my mind to. These are my thoughts on modern day schools and classes.","{'Total number of sentences': 28, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 21, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 1}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 1, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (25, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 25: ['user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 28'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( 'prompt', 'gpt3-call' ) ), 'user' )",DiGraph with 7 nodes and 6 edges,19,49," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between the action 'prompt', the action 'gpt3-call' and the action 'user'"
68,92d3272c14f94dc3b174d21b5592e417,"What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, stereotypes are often intolerable because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.

However, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. 

That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""loud black woman"" are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them. And strangely, while the number of people who complain about stereotypes has increased drastically, the number of stereotypes that are used in modern works hasn't decreased a bit. In fact, I find more stereotypes in modern works, than in works created a long time ago. This suggests to me, that the problem isn't so much stereotypes, or ignorance. The actual problem is that modern writers are just too untalented, and lazy, to do better.

So the problem of stereotypes in writing won't be fixed, until the problem of bad writers is fixed; the person waiting for that to occur, will be waiting a long time.","{'Total number of sentences': 19, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 4, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 2, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 12}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 24, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 19, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 19}","[(4, array(['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (5, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (6, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call',

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.""

My presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by ""JFK"". I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances. This ""JFK"" knew I was retired and wanted me to call a number, only containing 4 numbers. I will be honest in saying that the letter sent a chill down my spine. Out of curiosity, I reached for my phone and dialed the number. A gruff voice answered and asked me to confirm my identity by pressing my fingerprint on my phone. The man verified my identity and asked me to pack some bags, wanting me to meet him at the airport. I packed quickly, left a note for Michelle and was on my way to the airport. I stood in the terminal for a few minutes, when a man dressed in a black suit and tie approached me. ""Mr. Obama, please come this way."" I hesitantly followed the man for I did not know this stranger in the black suit. He lead me to a private plane, with the license plate reading ""The Flying White House"". The man in the black suit opened the door for me, and I entered the plane. The inside of the plane was similar to Air Force One, but more regal. The man in the black suit closed the door and told me to have a seat, ""Mr. Kennedy will be here shortly"". Somehow I had a feeling that this was some joke meant to ease me into my retirement.  I sat down in a leather seat, and waited for JFK to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, a man in a grey suit boards the plane, I could not see his face. He makes his way toward me and I realize that the man is in fact JFK. I am gobsmacked, this is not a joke. I stood up to shake his hand and to show my respect for a previous president. He sat down across from me and asked, ""do you realize why I have called on you?"". I told him I had no idea what any of this was about, but it must be important to national security. JFK told me that a threat of nuclear war is imminent and I must act accordingly. I told him that I no longer had the power because I was no longer president. I was the wrong person to ask to partake in this job. But JFK argued otherwise, he said that I was the only person who could handle this kind of job. I asked him what he wanted me to do. JFK dropped a folder on the table in front of me, and told me that he wanted me to read it. The file within revealed that the current president was a robot created by the Russians, to start a nuclear war. JFK showed me a device that looked like a pencil, built to disable the robot and stop the threat. The pencil device was meant to be inserted into the center of the robot's CPU and it would cause him to crash and burn. JFK wanted me to go The White House for a ""visit"", so that I could meet the robot president and disable him. I accepted the mission and shook JFK's hand. I left the plane, which took off quickly into the sky. I called Michelle and left a message, telling her I would be paying a visit to The White House for old times sake. I made my way out of the airport, and to the nearest cab. I arrived at The White House and made my way to the interior. Everyone greeted me as if I had neve left. I soon spotted the robot president and introduced myself again. I asked to talk with him in private away from prying eyes. He agreed and we made our way to his office. I pulled out the pencil device and asked him to sit in a chair. I made my move and grabbed him by the neck, shoving the pencil into his head where the CPU was. I activated the device, shutting down the robot in his chair. I had to get out quickly without being noticed. I went out the back door behind the resolute desk and looked for a cab. My phone rang, JFK called me to congratulate me on a mission well done.  He said I had served my country well once more. He had sent a special car to pick me up and take me home. I got into the car and walked in calmly, seeing Michelle and the girls back from the beach. She asked how my day went and I said ""it could not have gone any better"", with a smirk.  I think I was going to enjoy the rest of my retirement.","{'Total number of sentences': 73, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 5, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 54,

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. It causes those who took the drug to become mindless zombies. You and your friends now have to survive as the earth is being overrun by these zombies.

It's not a smooth journey. Your group is people who are close to 90 years old trying to evade zombies. Each attack kills a big chunk of the group as they are too weak to fight and too slow to run. So, how do you survive? How do you get your group to safety? I decide to lead the survivors to an island. On the way to the island, we come across a couple of villages that have survived and are willing to help us. They share supplies and give us a place to rest. 

After a while we end up in front of a row of islands. There's one that stands out as it looks large enough for us to live on. This is where we will settle. We begin setting up little huts and finding food and a water source. It's going pretty well at first. But then, a group of people arrives on their yacht. It's another group of seniors. They however are rich and demand the island for themselves. They claim my group are just squatters and that we've taken more than our share.

A fight ends up developing. It's quite a sight to see. People are falling and breaking their hips. Others are just sitting down to catch their breath. This ends up catching the attention of the zombies who are on the mainland. Many gather, watching in amusement. 
My group and the other seniors make an uneasy truce.
 We'll live together on the island and just avoid each other. We realize we don't have much time left to live anyway so we may as well not spend our last days fighting. The zombies would enjoy watching it too much.

71,992ccdb3cd144e62aa7cddce5efbac3d,"An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. Aliens have been living in harmony with humans for years now so we are not sure why all of a sudden they have turned on us! We must stop them!  The aliens need to learn that they cannot be kidnapping humans and taking them for experiments.

Other top leaders and myself had a meeting about what to do this morning and tried to come up with a plan to get Matt Damon back to earth as quickly as possible. We were able to track the alien spaceship and we also know that Matt Damon is alive and well as he has been seen hanging out with the aliens.  

Now that we know where he is all we have to do is board the ship.  I assemble a team of my top astronauts for the job.   The problem is that the aliens have put an invisibility shield around their ship so we cannot see it. 

The astronauts are searching desperately for the ship but just can't find it with the invisibility shield in place.  I begin to think.  I have an idea! I am going to build a rocket that will shoot a laser at the invisibility shield and knock it down. I built my laser fast as lightening and aimed at the ship.  Fire!  The shield is gone and the astronauts have a clear view of the ship.  It worked!

The astronauts dock and get out to explore the alien spaceship.  The roam the halls in search of Matt Damon.  Suddenly, one of the astronauts spots him.   ""Matt Damon, we have come to get you back on earth."" he says.  Matt begins to run alongside the astronauts back towards the shuttle.  They make it aboard just in time before the aliens even notice they were there.  The hatch closes, seals, and the shuttle engines begin to turn on. The shuttle launches into space and heads back towards earth.

It is a quiet and satisfying trip back to earth as the team know they saved Matt and saved the day.  But, now the bigger fight begins.  How will we stop the aliens from doing it again?

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. And interestingly, there are none! Scientists deem that this drug has absolutely no risk at all and that the side effects are limited to just a mild sense of happiness upon initially taking the drug. So, the government decides to release the drug to all citizens. No population is deemed too high-risk to take it. This means that you are administered the drug at once, at the age of 85. The only problem is that you are still 85. Yes, you have immorality now, but what does that mean? You can't leave your house. You are bedridden. You can't go to the grocery store. You can't take care of many of your basic needs. In fact, you have a hospice nurse who stays with you on most days. You are just sitting in bed, waiting to die....only now, this drug guarantees that you are going to stay in this lingering state between life and death forever. You will not get to let go of the pain and aches that you feel in your legs, back and arms. Honestly, this sounds hellish to you. Moreover, you are 85 years old, but the people around you are decades younger. This means that other people are still laughing, talking, engaging in relationships with each other, dating, partying, working, and generally enjoying their lives.

She is willing to help you now, but what if she looks away just long enough for you to get up and grab that prescription bottle on the counter? You decide to distract her. “Hey, what are you doing tonight?” you say. She checks the calendar on her phone to see if she has any plans scheduled. While she looks her plans up, you snatch the prescription bottle on the counter. She is still looking up her plans and decides to check the weather app too, so she doesn't notice that you've grabbed the bottle. She's now scrolling through pictures on her phone. You decide to down the whole bottle of pills since she is still not looking. As you swallow, you begin to feel woozy. You begin to feel the initial effects of the pills. Unfortunately, you realize once the bottle of pills is down in your stomach that you are still immortal, which means the searing pain and hot flashes you now feel will not actually kill you. You begin to feel stupid. What were you thinking? Your nurse now realizes what you've done. She quickly rushes over to you. “What did you do?!” she says. “I'm sorry,” you say as you begin to cry. “I'm not happy living like this. I'm tired of it."" The nurse nods.

Do you think all people should have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? I do. I believe that people should be knowledgeable and informed about local and national issues at the very least. How can we as citizens form well-thought out opinions without knowledge and facts? To do what's best for ourselves, family, and country we have a responsibility and civic duty to stay up to date and informed about current events. 

If we do not fulfill our civic duty as citizens then our opinions and decisions will not be based on facts. if our opinions are not based on facts then this might led to conflict with others, especially when one doesn't have any logical reasons to say why they feel one way or another about a specific topic. If you are unable to explain why you think or feel like you do about a specific topic, how can you expect others to listen to what you have to say or respect your views? The answer is, they won't.

here are people who don't think it is their responsibility to keep up with news.
 They want to believe what they want to believe to be true or share the same views with someone that they like regardless of whether or not their views are based on facts or not. We are all guilty of this at some point in our lives. But we need to gather data and information from reliable sources, preferably multiple sources so that we know whether or not something is factual or fake news. This way, we can then form well-rounded opinions and make informed decisions and be able to communicate and share our views with friends, family, and co-workers.
WWith today's technology, w are sverylucky to have the access to all of the current news information wthat e need right at our fingertips.
 We can access current world, national, and local news with our computers, cell phones, and TVs. Everyone can form reasonable and logical stances on current events using these modern forms of technology.

This was a shock to the leaders and the nation. The came out of isolation to a world that was unrecognizable. All nation states were destroyed or dissolved after the great war. In their place were corporations or mega-corporations that had large areas of land in which they ruled. These new corporations had the money and power that the old superpowers used to have. They controlled no only the distribution of goods but the whole economy and the well being of every living being on earth. 
The United States before the war was a force for good and kept these corporations and other tyrannical forms of government in check.

The United States decided to play the long game and come up with a plan to ultimately take down these entities and restore freedom and democracy to the world. After several years of research, the United States military developed a way to take down the mega-corporation's power structure by destroying their ability to gather relevant data on their consumers. This led to massive supply line disruptions that led the population to revolt. 
Before the United States reemerged, the rest of the world had no way to fight back but the U.S. had used the 50 years of isolation to build the most powerful and sophisticated military in history. Over the course of two decades the United States and their newly formed allies cooperated and eventually brought down the evil corporations that once ruled the world and every living being in it.","{'Total number of sentences': 17, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 2, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 11, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 2}","[(2, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (3, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (4, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (5, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (6, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{2: ['prompt', 'user'], 3: ['user'], 4: ['user'], 5: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 6: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 2'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 17'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user' )",DiGraph with 10 nodes and 10 edges,1,12," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user'"

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

It turns out that people, over the years, have experienced sharper than normal degradation to their mental processes. People who have been taking the drug continue to look young, but they degrade mentally and emotionally. It gets really pronounced after about 50 years. 
You're a member of the Lost Generations.
 You have experienced normal degradation, but the people around you, who all appear young, are very different form you. They are cold, unfeeling, and distant. You hardly go outside anymore, in your golden years. You can't stand to be around them. 
You have a daughter, who is a member of the Young Generations.
 You have witnessed the changes in her, over time. She was a very warm and caring person earlier in her life, but as she reached middle age she began to change. She became cold and distant. She would get lost in some internal thought, and it would be almost impossible to get her attention. 
You know that the drug is the cause of this.
 You want to help her, but you've never even taken the drug and have no idea what she is feeling. After a few years, she begins to scare you. There is a cold emptiness in her eyes, and she no longer expresses any affection for anyone, even her own children. 
One day, you're sitting at home, and she comes in.
 She says nothing, she only stares. You try to greet her and make idle conversation. She continues to stare at you in silence. You ask her if she's ok. She suddenly breaks into a rage, like you've never seen before. She screams at you, telling you that you're a monster, that you're a horrible person, that you're a terrible father, and that you need to die. She picks up a glass and throws it at you. She begins tearing up the room, throwing everything in her path toward your aging body. She screams unintelligible, unformed words toward you. She turns bright red. She charges toward you. You can't move. She slams into you like a runaway freight train. 

Once you're on the floor, she begins tearing at your flesh. She takes bite sized chunks of your flesh into her mouth and swallows. She takes your blood into her mouth and drinks it.

76,a215d4b3242a4e999ee6fafdd793cac6,"Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

Millions of people have vision problems that make it difficult to read. Even large point books are not suitable for them.  This is not a problem confined to people born with vision issues or blindness, but it is a problem almost everyone encounters at some point as they age.
The solution is to listen to books.
 But until about 20 years ago, the only way to obtain this service was to use a volunteer service like Talking Books. This is a service provided by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. It is a free service to the blind and visually impaired.
The service is provided by volunteers who read books into a recording device.
 Though the volunteers are well-intentioned, they are not professional readers. The result is that the books can be read in a monotonous or garbled voice.
Theough the obviouo slution to this problem is to use a professional reader., only a small percentage of released books were also released in audiobook format back then
 And audio books were expensive: a book which costs $25 in print form could cost almost twice that amount when ordered on CDs.
However, in the last 20 years, the number of books available in audiobook format has increased dramatically.
 And services like Audible can ensure a steady supply of books for listeners for a relatively small subscription payment.

That brings us up to the present. And now we are in a position to answer the question: what is the benefit of audiobooks? In this context, the clear benefit is that audiobooks can empower the disabled and enable those with vision issues to fully participate in the world of books and literature as never before.

Audiobooks are a beacon of equal rights and equal access for the disabled, and as such should be subsidized and expanded.

When the US found this out, they started asking the world why. The world said that they didn't know what would happen to the US, because during the war another country had released a bioweapon inside the US with a virus. Now every single American was infected with a virus that caused them to go into a rage after they died, but the virus failed and that wasn't the result. Instead infected people turned into something called ""Neo Zombies"", which were humans that possessed superhuman strength and agility after 25 years.

The US said yes, that did happen, be we starved it out and cleaned up the mess so the virus is dead. The world then says that they need to perform an inspection of the US and if they find anything wrong, they will treat them as an isolated nation again, and that they were sorry.

So the world sent their very best doctors and scientists to ships stationed outside the US, and began the process of screening, and testing many of millions of American citizens. They did this by taking blood samples and giving the US people exams, as well as looking at their eyes and lungs. After testing millions and millions of American citizens, they did not find even one small trace of the virus anywhere. So they concluded that the virus is dead and that the US should be let out of isolation and allowed to rejoin the world. They removed their ships, and fully lifted the quarantine of America. Then the world went back to normal, with lasting peace.

78,aa092c2e66ea48d89361cc668d7d4919,"When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you. You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.

I don't remember how I got here, in this dimly lit, heavenly cinema with all of these people.  I try hard to remember what happened previously by asking the people in the cinema where we are. The person in front of me turns around and says ""be quiet, the show is about to start"".  To my surprise, the person in front of me looks similar to me, but with a subtle difference in facial structure. I turn around to the people behind me, but they all seem to look like my past reincarnations. I soon realize and remember, that I died in a tragic car accident at the age of 36. I was driving home after my birthday party, and a drunken driver crashed into my car. Even though I was wearing my seatbelt, I did not survive such an impact. uddenly, I begin watching a movie on the big screen in front of me.
 The man in the movie is a reincarnation of myself, but with subtle differences. I soon realize that this movie is about to start my new life. It feels odd to watch yourself live a life from the outside. he life on the big screen in front of me is similar to my previous life, but with subtle differences.
 In this life, I work at a big hospital, as a well respected surgeon, quite the difference from being a lawyer previously. This person is getting ready to perform a surgery on a small child. I remember that I used to take my children to a petting zoo when they were small. I always loved looking at them experience new things. It makes me wonder how my children and wife are doing, knowing that I have died. I understand that it is no longer about my past life, but about my reincarnated self. I am no longer worried about my loved ones, because I know that they will be fine. I feel a little bit at peace with myself, knowing that they will be taken care of. I continue to watch the movie in front of me, hoping that my reincarnated self with have a great life. hen I was watching this movie, I noticed that the life of my reincarnated self seemed to be an improvement from my past life.
 This self was more extroverted and daring, which was the complete opposite of myself. This person was living a life that I would have wanted to live, and it seems as though everything is going well. He seems to have a lot going for him, a great family, kids, the works. I am no longer upset about my death, because I know that my reincarnated self is living a much better life. I decided to stand up from my seat and walk out of the cinema, to see what waited for me on the outside. I walk outside, and I am shocked to see that the cinema which I was previously in was no longer there. In front of me was a beautiful city filled with skyscrapers and people going on with their daily routines. The architecture was built out of beautiful, golden, steel, brick and marble. The streets were clean and people were smiling and waving at me. Soon after, a man approached me, who went by the name Peter. I quickly understood that this man was Saint Peter, the gatekeeper. He offered to take me on a tour and to meet the person in charge. We walked for what seemed to be an hour in the wonderful city. Finally, we reached a set of giant, golden doors. I immediately knew that this was where the creator of our world resided. I was never much for the belief in an almighty being, but I guess I was wrong. The doors open and Peter points me in the direction of the creator. I walk up to the creator and I am both in awe and surprised. The creator is a woman, not a man as we were taught on Earth. She tells me that I lived a good life, with people who loved and respected me. It made me feel better about the whole situation. She continues to tell me that I can choose to continue my life, or I can choose to go back and restart my life again. It was a tempting offer, to go back to Earth and live with my loving family, but I know that it was the wrong decision. I enjoyed my life for what it was and now it was someone else's turn to live their life in my body. I tell the creator that I would like to continue my life, because I felt as though I could make a difference in this world. She smiles and sends me on my way back to the city. Peter then takes me to my residence and gives me a job. I know that I have chosen the right life, and it will be a pleasure to live it. I know that I can make a difference here and help people. Instead of being a lawyer, I have been chosen to be a doctor, like my reincarnated self. It is nerve wracking and exciting at the same time. I never had a problem with blood and I was always interested in medicine. Maybe it was why my reincarnated self became a doctor and not a boring lawyer. I am happy that I get a second chance to do something exciting and more fulfilling in this new life. I know that one day I will be with my family again, and we will be happy here. My time on Earth came and went, and for that I will always be grateful to have had the opportunity to experience a mortal life.","{'Total number of sentences': 61, 'Number of sentences of initial

80,b30238629d9040b192604dfd1f7d3eaa,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty”? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, it should be up to the school to decide whether or not to provide free pads and tampons. In this day and age, every school is under different circumstances. Some schools are in poverty, and some schools have a lot of money. Some schools are balanced when it comes to gender, and then there are schools that are all female. Some schools have a lot of students, and some schools have a small amount of students. Whether or not to provide a new supply to students comes down to money in the budget. Each school would need to look at their budget and funding to see if they could afford to provide free pads and tampons. If their funds allow it, then they are free to make feminine hygiene products available to students. If they can't afford to do this, they can look at alternate ways of funding this. For example, they could have a fundraiser to raise money for this. They could ask for donations from the community.

Another thing that schools could do is offer students the ability to stay home when menstruating. This would allow students to have a day off from school when they are experiencing heavy bleeding. This would lessen the burden of the students needing hygiene products at school.  Supplies would last longer and make it more affordable for the school to provide them.  Schools can do any combination of these suggestions to help students who are experiencing period poverty.  This can hopefully improve the health and wellness of the students for all of their years in school.","{'Total number of sentences': 24, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 9}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 15, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 10, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 10}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (12, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (20, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (21, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (22, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (23, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (24, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 9: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 12: ['user', 'empty-call'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 20: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 21: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 22: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 23: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 24: ['gpt3-call']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 24'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( 'prompt', 'gpt3-call' ) ), X( tau, *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 14 edges,2,19," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between the action 'prompt', the action 'gpt3-call' and an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

---

Technology has made dating better. When just going to a bar was the best way to meet someone, you were limited to very few people that you'd actually want to talk to after. Now, the chances of meeting someone on a dating app that really catches your eye has increased exponentially. 

Technology has slowly been improving our perspectives. Early television showed us the possibility of different kinds of relationships. 
etflix shows us realistic examples of relationships where one or more characters have some kind of disability.
 ocial media gives us the opportunity to look at the silly sides of being in a relationship as well as sad.
 You can research anything on the internet from health to dating to getting married.

 research conducted at the University of Virginia revealed that couples who watch romantic comedy movies tend to have higher marriage satisfaction than those who don't.
 The researchers found that while watching romantic comedy movies, loving and caring feelings were enhanced between the partners. 
Many believe that the internet has facilitated romantic relationships.
 Texting, dating apps, ad social media allow us to have a relationship with the perfect person, while thousands of miles away. If things don't work out, it becomes easy to end the relationship. 

I've met some of my best friends on social media. We often started out in groups with common interests. We'd chat a bit here and there, nothing too personal or deep. We learned about each other, talked about our lives a little and slowly became closer.  

I've met the most important person in my life on a social media. He is pretty much my everything right now. We were casual for a while, just liking each others' pictures and having fun.   Soon we started text each other more often, and started going out for coffee or for a run. It slowly became deeper, we started opening up more and getting closer. Things progressed, we became a couple and have been happy together for just over two and a half years now!

Technology has the power to bring us closer to each other. And in becoming closer, we can find love.!","{'Total number of sentences': 34, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 9, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 15}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 25, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 16, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 9, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 12}","[(9, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (22, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (25, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'],

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, I never like the villain. They always end up being just plain evil. I understand that yes, they are necessary for the storyline.  But I have such a hard time with their characters. Especially the ones who spend a lot of time planning and are so smart; to me that just comes across as egotistical and bossy. These are traits that I find to be very unappealing and unattractive. Even in real life, these kinds of people are repulsive. If I was a character in a book, movie or T.V show, I would definitely go out of my way to thwart the plans of the villain. 
Another stereotype that I despise is the naive, innocent person.
 Some people are just asking to get themselves into trouble. I can't stand when people are so naïve they don't even realize they are being led into a trap. One example is Sydney from Scream. I feel like she was the biggest weak character.  It was hard to watch her make all the mistakes she made. She was more blind than any of the characters in any horror movies I have ever watched. I kept thinking about how differently I would've acted if I were in her shoes.   I actually never finished the whole series. She was an example of a movie character that inspired me to become like the opposite.  That's one way to be inspired by bad movie characters.

83,b6e3af6257c84970bf770a3b30c573c7,"Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?

Would you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.

Why do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?

---

In my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. 

The truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with ""baseball bats"" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. 

Sories about animal abuse are much more visual.
 Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. 

We should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans healthier and happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other people or animals.

The President of the United States was already involved. President Biden had been briefed on the situation, and was ready to take action. The government's task force, lead by Biden's top aide, named ""Bobby"", was ready to go. Bobby was coincidently Matt Damon's co-star in the 1998 movie, Saving Private Ryan as an extra.

""Bobby, are we ready to go?"" asked the President. Bobby replied, ""Yes sir, we are ready to go. But first, I have to tell you something."" 

""What is it?"" President Biden asked.

""I have to tell you that I'm Matt Damon."" Said Bobby.

""What?"" Said the President shocked. ""You're Matt Damon? But who's on that ship?""

Bobby, who has removed his elaborate mask to reveal himself as Matt Damon, then replied, ""It's a decoy Matt Damon filled with bombs ready to detonate at your command, sir.""

""This is spectacular,"" said the President. ""But how did you do it?""

""It was easy, sir,"" said Matt. ""First, I had to get the attention of the alien. Then, I had to get him to kidnap the decoy, which was very easy to do as it was a very close replica of me.

I quickly scanned the mug to see if my name was on the list. I was not technically a dad, but still a step-dad. I figured i would still be on the list since i did all i could do to raise the kids in the best way i knew how. I wasnt sure if i was dreaming or if this was real, however in the moment all i cared about was looking at the list on my mug. I didnt even take a sip of the coffee. My mouth was open and my eyes were focused on the mug.  thought maybe i should make sure my eyes werent playing tricks on me.
 Alas, there it was. I saw my name. I read the number beside my name.   was #1 Dad.
 I wasnt sure if it was real or not. I didnt feel anything. I just....... looked.   quickly began to look at the rankings of all the other dads.
 What makes me any better than anyone else? I wasnt even a biological father, am i really doing that well? I know that i loved the kids, and maybe that was all that mattered. I know that i would do anything for them, as i am sure many other dads would. What made be stand apart? I know there are plenty of dads who work just as hard as i do, and they deserve to be #1 too. I turned the mug around, looked on the bottom and everywhere i could think of. Is there some sort of explanation or criteria for this? I want to know what it is exactly i am doing so well? Why do i always question when someone compliments me? I am not perfect, i know that. Why do i not believe this list, despite the kids and my fiancee never saying anything but good about me? All that mattered to me were the kids knowing that i was there for them. Knowing that i would do whatever they needed me for. All this mug was doing was making me question myself, but maybe that is why I am #1. Maybe I am because i am my toughest critic. Maybe I am because i am selfless and just want to make others happy. Maybe I am #1 because of how others think of me? Why cant i think of me the same way they do? Why cant i just enjoy this? I dont know the answer to any of these questions...but I hope to figure them out someday. I think i am almost ready to sit down and enjoy this cup of coffee.","{'Total number of sentences': 38, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 1, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 27, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 9}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 15, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 11, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 7}","[(1, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (2, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (3, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (4, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (12, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (31, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (32, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (34, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (35, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (36, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (37, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9')), (38, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3'], dtype='<U11'))]","{1: ['prompt', 'user'], 2: ['user'], 3: ['user'], 4: ['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'empty-call', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 12: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user', 'empty-call'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user'], 31: ['user'], 32: ['user'], 33: ['user'], 34: ['user'], 35: ['user'], 36: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 37: ['gpt3-call'], 38: ['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 1'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 38'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'modify-gpt3'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( *( 'gpt3-call', tau ), X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), X( tau, +( X( tau, *( 'empty-call', tau ) ), 'user' ) ) )",DiGraph with 16 nodes and 20 edges,21,37," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by a loop between the actions the action 'gpt3-call', a silent action and an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and an exclusive choice between a silent action,  in parallel with an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions the action 'empty-call', a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and the action 'user'"

Do you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?

In “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,"" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.""

Do you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?

---

In my opinion, paying college athletes is an excellent idea. 
For one, I think it would help provide a more stable future for many student-athletes.
 It is well-known that a good amount of student athletes don't go on to play for the pros after college, and those that do, aren't guaranteed a very high salary or even a job in the field they played. 
The best example to use in terms of the advantages of paying college players is the UAustralias fsoccerpand rugby rogram.s. The universities benefit from their players in promos, ticket sales, and other perks that allow the school to generate positive funds. Students who are lucky enough to be a part of the team can receive just about anything they ask for off the field and still receive free tuition, room, board, and the opportunity to be on a university team. If a player gets injured, that player is also provided with insurance, along with a stipend for their education.  

Additionally, athletes can gain endorsement money, and do advertising for companies. They can capitalize on the popularity of their images, and their place on the school's team. There is widespread satisfaction for this program by all players.

If this same system were allowed in the United States, many colleges would be able to provide the same service that the Australia implements. ot only does paying college athletes create a more stable future for student-athletes, but it also creates a more fair society where those
 who make the most money for their schools, get the most amount of money back from their schools. 

College sports can also be seen as a leveler, where kids who couldn't afford to play for professional teams would have an opportunity to play for prestigious college teams. If college athletes were paid, it could lead to all kinds of new talent for universities and professional sports teams, which would be very difficult to ignore. 

It would be advantageous to pay our athletes, to repay them for their efforts, and to give them more opportunities.  It's time we overhauled the system and followed the lead of other countries in college sports!

89,c286d6136e35488f967ec0581cc49cfd,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, it is not selfish to pursue risky, extreme sports.  All sports have a risk of injury. and death  There are people that have died from playing football and boxing.  Looking at boxing, for example, many boxers experience brain damage by the time they retire.   There are boxers who have also died in the ring.  If sports like mountain climbing are selfish due to the risk, then sports like boxing should be as well.  
 
I believe that it is not selfish to pursue extreme sports, as long as the person is aware of the risks.  Ultimately, whether an athlete participates in a sport is their choice.  If they are willing to accept the risk,  they should be allowed to participate in any sport.  Now, I would say that the sport should be made as safe as possible.  There should be regulations to ensure the maximum possible safety.  If there is a high chance of death due to a lack of regulation, then I don't think it should be called a sport.  
For example, in the sport of boxing, there are regulations to ensure the safety of the boxers.
  There are medical professionals on hand to treat the boxers.  There are referees who are supposed to protect the health of the boxers as much as possible.   The trainers of the boxers have the ability to stop the fight by ""throwing in the towel"".     


I think if extreme activities like mountain climbing have proper safety regulations in place, they should definitely be considered sports.

90,c4e852c4b21b4703a485d93b618361cd,"Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. The uranium got to the pig and made him sick. So sick that he became zombie pig. He went out into the world and ate all the other pigs. That is what he enjoyed. Surprisingly the other pigs he ate wasn't his 99 brothers and sisters. They managed to get back to the farm. His brothers and sisters wondered what happened to 92 and if he was okay. 

This is when 92 found the farm and found his brothers and sisters. 92 thought he had hit the jackpot. A place with 99 other pigs. He could be fed for years he though. He then got the idea to strike at night. None of the other pigs saw or knew of this plan. Night had then fallen. 92 prepared to go on his rampage. The other pigs where relaxing and enjoying each others company. When out of nowhere 92 jumped out of the bushes to attack. He attacked one of his sisters and bit her on the leg. His sister squealed in pain. The other pigs heard the squeal and went to see what was going on. They recognized 92 and wondered what madness was going on. The other pigs fought off 92 and pinned him to the ground. They then took him to the barn and tied him up. Surprisingly no one else was hurt. His sister was fine as well as she was taken care of. And since it was uranium that made zombie pig she wouldn't turn into a zombie.

While 92 was hung up the other pigs wondered what to do. They didn't know how to get him back. One of them though maybe to ask mother pig what to do since she was not around when the chaos went down. They get her and she is happy to see 92 and is confused why he his hung up and shaking and squealing. She asks what happened and they tell her. She is shocked by the news. The mom gets close. She believes she can snap him out of it. She demands him to be cut down. The others say no he will bite. She says she must do it. They cut him down and he immediately leaps on his mom. But the mom ends up on top and pins him to the ground. She stares at him trying to get him to remember. The squirming of 92 begins to calm down. He is confused. Somehow his memories as a baby pig floods him. He remembers his mom and all the good times they had. He remembers his brothers and sisters and all the good time they had. He then says ""Mom""? ""Yes honey I am your mom"" she replies. 

He has snapped out of it. The rest of the pigs celebrate.  They all hug and kiss 92. They are happy that they all have their family back together in one place. 92 is happy to be back with his family as well.  The end.","{'Total number of sentences': 58, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 5, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 45, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 8}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 9, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 7, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 5}","[(5, array([], dtype=float64)), (6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (31, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (32, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (34, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (35, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (36, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (37, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (38, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (39, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (40, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (41, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (42, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (43, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (44, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (45, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (46, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (47, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (48, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (49, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (50, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (51, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (52, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (53, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (54, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (55, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (56, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (57, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (58, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{5: [], 6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user'], 31: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 32: ['user'], 33: ['user'], 34: ['user'], 35: ['user'], 36: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 37: ['user'], 38: ['user'], 39: ['user'], 40: ['user'], 41: ['user'], 42: ['user'], 43: ['user'], 44: ['user'], 45: ['user'], 46: ['user'], 47: ['user'], 48: ['user'], 49: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 50: ['user'], 51: ['user'], 52: ['user'], 53: ['user'], 54: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 55: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 56: ['user'], 57: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 58: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 5'}, 'events': []}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 58'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","X( tau, ->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( 'user', 'empty-call' ) ) )",DiGraph with 13 nodes and 14 edges,9,8,"an exclusive choice between a silent action,  followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions the action 'user', the action 'empty-call', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

The coronavirus pandemic ended the screen time debate: Screens won. We all now find ourselves on our screens for school, for work and for connecting with family and friends during this time of social distancing and increased isolation.

But should we be worried about this excessive screen use right now? Or should we finally get over it and embrace the benefits of our digital devices?

---

In my opinion, spending so much time with our faces in front of screens is making insidious changes within us which we should definitely be worried about.  am not talking about the obvious physical changes like the fact that we are all getting fat and our eyesight is getting worse.
 There are deep changes happening within our minds and spirits which we cannot know the ramifications of. There is no doubt that our modern devices come with inherent benefits. But there are also many negative consequences which we are just beginning to understand. Having all this information available is clearly something that we must see as a positive thing. But, let's be honest with ourselves. Do we really spend most of our time in front of screens learning and improving our minds? Or do we mostly just use our devices to distract ourselves from the world around us? We are becoming addicted to constant distraction and losing our normal interactive functionality. There is something very damaging, in the long run, about not ever taking a moment for quiet self reflection.  am not saying that we should all go back to the old days of sitting in front of the TV for hours on end.
 That was the precursor to this culture of distraction. Now, with modern devices, we take our TV (our distraction) with us everywhere we go. We must not let this addictive tendency control us. It's important to take back our attention, our very minds, for the sake of our mental health.","{'Total number of sentences': 22, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 12, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 2}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 22'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user' )",DiGraph with 10 nodes and 10 edges,1,12," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user'"
92,c6fe39f226d74fa59bd666ff93329993,"Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?

Have you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty""? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?

---

In my opinion, pads and tampons should be the girl's responsibility. It should not be the schools responsibility to make sure female hygiene products are available. We dont have enough money for the schools as it is. We need to cut back on what we can to save money and add it to the learning budget. Plus kids waste things more then they use them. There would be pads all over the walls of the schools if they were freely dispensed. Boys would use more of them then the girls. It is just in their nature to cause trouble with these kinds of things. So in other words in would be more of a distraction then a help. 
By the time girls are old enough to need these kinds of products they are responsible enough to bring them when needed. If they are not responsible enough to do that then they are not responsible enough to be in school and other forms of education needs to be explored. I would not be opposed to cutting back on things like toilet paper and soap too. Kids just use it to cause trouble not clean themselves up. I am willing to bet that more money is spent on toilet paper then math and science classes. I dont know that for a fact but my gut never lies. Kids lie though, they cheat, steal and cause trouble with everything they have at their disposal. So why would we give them more things to cause trouble with? Let the young ladies worry about their female issues so the boys can focus more on their work and not on defacing school property.

In my opinion, we should be concerned about the excessive screen time that has taken place over the pandemic. Although it has been necessary because of the situation, I know that too much time staring at a screen can have negative effects on someone's health. For one, too much screen time can hurt a persons ability to fall asleep at night.  know that I have been having trouble falling asleep at night because of the amount of time I spend on my computer., especially if I'm working too late. And although connecting through devices can help us feel more connected, if kids are using them to play games and use them as an escape for too many extended periods, it seems like it could have the opposite effect and increase isolation over time due to less social activity. 
Another reason I think we should be concerned about excessive screen time is because it can cause eye strain. Straining our eyes for many hours a day can cause headaches and other issues. All in all I think that yes we should be concerned. Although our devices have been our lifeline during this pandemic, I think we should back off of the excessive use over time because too much of it just isn't healthy.","{'Total number of sentences': 15, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 4, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 5}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 9, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 6, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call',

In my opinion, we shouldn't be worried about screen use, we should be grateful that we have it. he benefits of screen time are so great that it is hard to imagine how we would have survived the pandemic without them.
 For starters, when the pandemic began, people quickly found ways of working remotely with the use of technology. Screen time became work time and with that, lots of people that normally work in an office were able to earn a living from home.
creen time also helped us tstayconnect edwith friends and family.
 I know I have older family members who are hard of hearing, and the ability to face time them meant they could still see my face, which helped them better understand me. I'm sure there are many others who benefited this way in keeping up with family members. Screen time also helped us stay informed.
 With so much going on during Covid, and our social lives put on hold, the internet or even the local news became our lifelines. I used to keep up with news by talking to people everyday, but with the start of Covid I was suddenly without that and had to depend on screen time of any sort in order to keep up with the many developing events. SOne of the most helpful benefits of screen use the past year or so has been the ability of students to use their screens to continue school. It hasn't been perfect but at least on some level, students have been able to continue interacting with educators and keeping some sort of pace as it pertains to learning. 
I know excessive screen use has its potential downsides, but in today's situation it should not be of concern. There are far more benefits of our screen use in this moment than problems to worry about.  In conclusion, no, I do not think people should be worried about excessive screen use - At all.","{'Total number of sentences': 20, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 10, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 5, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 1}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user', 'empty-call'], 13: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 20'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 13 edges,10,13," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call'"

World War III was a devastating, violent affair, that took a heavy toll on the nations of the world. The United States was hit particularly hard, with the majority of its major cities being destroyed. The American food production infrastructure was hit particularly hard, causing massive waves of starvation and famine within every social class. America, like many nations of the world, were forced to rebuild its cities, economies and food production. he United States government, in order to prevent another World War, decided to isolate itself from the rest of the world for 50 years.
 The other foreign nations also agreed to isolate for 50 years, in order to re-establish society and humanity. At first, it was tough, people were suffering from hunger, unemployment, and nightmares from the war. America did not trust the other nations to isolate as promised, expecting a surprise attack at any moment. However, as the years went on, and the world rebuilt itself, the fear of another war was gone. People established their daily routines, rebuilt cities, and had grown delicious food to feed the populace. Everything had gone back to normal, with people finding jobs and starting families again. The year was 2052, and the United States was ready to re-enter the world. The American government held grueling meetings to decide if it was a good time to come out of isolation, and reconnect with the world.  The American people were divided on whether or not to come out of hiding and risk another war. Many people were afraid that the other nations would not honor the 50 year agreement and attack the United States, while others were afraid that the United States would attack first and risk the lives of all Americans. The American government decided to come out of isolation, and see what the world was like. Messages were sent to many foreign countries to establish a network once more. After a few hours, there was no response from any foreign nation. The American government was surprised that nobody had answered. The American government decided to send a team of diplomats to the United Nations to see what was going on. When the diplomats arrived, the United Nations was eerily empty, like a haunted house on Halloween. The diplomats searched the premises for any signs of life, but found none. They contacted the American government to let them know that there were no signs of life. The diplomats decided to fly to Europe and investigate the situation there. When they arrived, they found the same thing, no signs of life. Only empty streets and desolate buildings filled the atmosphere with sounds of hollow winds. Finally, One of the diplomats discovered a skeleton in the middle of the street. The skeleton was dressed in tattered, lavish clothing, resembling those of a high ranking official. The diplomats decided to investigate the skeleton, and found a note in the pocket of the skeleton. The note contained a grim warning meant for the world, especially America. One day after America had gone into isolation, a deadly plague had spread like wildfire throughout the remaining nations. Human life was wiped out quickly, but had spared America because they were isolated from every other country, and had closed their borders. The diplomats sent the message to the American government, telling them of the grim outcome. The American government was devastated by the news, but they had no choice but to accept it. All of these years, the American populace was alone on planet Earth, filled with false hopes of a better future. The American government decided to let the populace know of the grim outcome, and to let them know that they were alone on Earth. The American people had no choice but to continue living and pushing forward. As time went on, people slowly repopulated the other landmasses that once belonged to foreign nations. Scientists discovered the cure for the plague, so that people would survive. The United States was the only nation to survive the plague, and was the only nation to survive the war. World War III became a reminder of how fragile life can be, more importantly, how useless violence is. The American people were determined to make the world a better place, and to never let another World War happen again.","{'Total number of sentences': 44, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 2, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 29, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 12}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 15, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 13, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 10}","[(2, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (3, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (4, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (5, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (6, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (31, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (32, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (34, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (35, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (36, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (37, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (38, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (39, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (40, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (41, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (42, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (43, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (44, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9'))]","{2: ['prompt', 'user'], 3: ['user'], 4: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 5: ['user'], 6: ['user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user'], 31: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 32: ['user'], 33: ['user'], 34: ['user'], 35: ['user'], 36: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 37: ['user'], 38: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 39: ['user'], 40: ['user'], 41: ['user'], 42: ['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], 43: ['user'], 44: ['gpt3-call']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 2'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 44'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), X( tau, *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) ) )",DiGraph with 15 nodes and 18 edges,39,10," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"
97,d647f1a5ad614d4eab842e795def2f2e,"Are We Being Bad Citizens If We Don't Keep Up With the News?

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In this digital age, I believe many are subjected to a lot of information, much more than is feasible to keep track of, to check the accuracy and validity of such information. In comparison to how things were in the past, we are bombarded with a lot more information, that goes beyond what is happening locally, to events that are all around the world. That isn't to say that is an inherently bad thing, in the past many of the injustices and issues that occurred worldwide would never be noted by people from other countries, who were primarily preoccupied with their own issues and struggles.  n fact, Ithink it is important to be aware of what is going on in the world, band the amount of information available to people allows them to be better citizens who are informed about the problems others in their country face, but also the problems that affects others in other countries as well. I however understand that being engaged and informed is a difficult matter in its own right, and that it is not practical or reasonaule to assume others will eep up
 with every event occurring in the world at a given point in time. 

Nonetheless, people should ideally have an idea of some events that are going on in the world, that goes beyond simply knowing just the basic gist of said story. Ideally, people should be able to inform others they meet up with regarding such events, to bring awareness to potential causes to people who can take action, or do something about it. I believe that doing such and effectively engaging with current events not only brings about discussion, but also action and change for the betterment of people. I have this line of thinking based on my own observations on how people engage with news, and the actions they take from being informed. For example, in the pat I have seen people who are informed about the refugee crisis in Syria, and how it is affecting people, take action to help those affected through volunteer work and donations to charity. This could easily not have occured had people not engaged with the news that are available to them, and the information present and accesible during the current digital age. Although as I mentioned many might hear said news and not engage with it to the same degree as others, I believe it isn't inherently difficult based on the demands and obligations many people have, which might make it more difficult for them to keep up with the news. As long as others do keep up with the news, to bring about discussion, action, and change for the better, it will be an overall positive outcome for people to have such information readily available through different formats and medias.","{'Total number of sentences': 18, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 10, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 2}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 6, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 3, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 2}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 18'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( *( 'gpt3-call', tau ), X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) )",DiGraph with 15 nodes and 18 edges,38,21," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by a loop between the actions the action 'gpt3-call', a silent action and an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

It reads ""I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job."" Signed simply, ""JFK.

I'm in shock. How can this be? I get my calculator app on the screen doing math, realizing that JFK was born in 1917, so... Nah. It can't really be real. Even if JFK somehow survived assassination, which I know is something that happened. After all I was privy to that thick file on him, checking it out with Michelle early in my first term, late one quiet evening.  So, No NOT really THE JFK. So the question is who? Also HOW did someone get into my room while I was sleeping. It's super creepy and worrying.  

My first call was to the head of Secret Service security on my detail. With so many death threats, I had a stellar cadre of security surrounding me. More than 5 serious assassination threats come my way every year.   I get Chet on the phone. ""No"" he says. ""No one could have breached"" no one, I think? Then How? What? I look around our bedroom. The ceiling is secure, windows locked, check list complete.  I think it MIGHT just be a prank. So... what to do next?

I call the number in the letter.
 Insisting Chet be on an extension, to get security insight, in real time.  I have a tracer also going, suggested by Chet.  So, it starts ringing. on the second ring, the voice seems shaky and somehow familiar. NO it COULD NOT be. Could it? ""Barak, it's Jack"". My reply is stunned silence, LONG silence. I finally summon up my inner strength and say simply. 'How'. ""Well, that's a long story"". I don't have time to get into it but we need to meet face to face.  I mention that I must include secret service for this to happen, I have too many active death threats to take this lightly. Jack says ""Sure, put Chet on"".  

Chet gets on his extension.  ""Hello"" he says. Then, I see his mouth drop, his face grow ashy and pale, and he seems to worsen, becoming childlike. Totally out of character. He croaks ""Yes sir"".  Then he hangs up. He tells me to get dressed, I begin doing that, putting on my khakis. He gets on the radio, held to his belt loop, calls in a couple of other agents, and coordinates with them.

A powerful politician named Chiang Kai-Shek is determined to take over the United States.
 The plan was for the other countries around the world to cut off ties from the USA and band forces together in order to take them over.  hen the idea was first conceived, it was believed that it would take a long time to do so.
 However, when the isolation proposition was proposed, it granted the perfect opportunity for the tides to shift. Specifically, China, North and South Korea,  and Japan all had plans to band together with whomever would join in order to take over the USA. Little did they know that although the USA had gone into isolation, they had an idea that something fishy was going on. Along with Ally's Russia, Canada, and Africa, will the USA be able to defind itself and the other nations from being taken over by Chiang Kai-Shek? The war is a relatively short one as the countries had been preparing for this moment for over fifty years. This was the most lethal war in history as Chiang Kai-Shek immediately started dropping bombs on the USA and its ally countries. If not for russia, China would have been able to do much more damage than it had previously done. Russia stormed their country and prevented the attacks long enough for the USA to fight back and send troops into the country. The USA, Canada, Russia, and Africa fought back with all they force they could come up with, and knocked off Chiang Kai-Shek once and for all. The war showed that you can not really ever truly trust other nations, and it increased the use of espionage greatly. This event marked an important point in history.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, people should not be pressured to keep up with the news, nor should they be made to feel inadequate if the don't do so. Ours is not a society like that of ancient Sparta where every male citizen filled the same role, that of soldier. People in our society fill many different roles and take a multitude of different paths in life. 
I think it is a good thing that people are not forced to be informed about the news.
 Some people simply don't have the interest or temperament for news. Should we dictate to every artist and poet that they must be more informed of worldly affairs? Many people make great contributions to society without having any interest in the news at all.   think that people should be free to choose what they want to know about.
 This type of freedom is pivotal to our way of life. We must remember that it is not only freedom of action that we should espouse but, crucially, freedom of thought. Shaming people who don't follow current affairs is simply a form of mental tyranny. It is important for us to allow this spirit of freedom to thrive and not try to dictate the interests of everybody. Of course it's true that the news is important. But it's also true that it is not the only thing that is important. Certainly many people should take an interest in current affairs and the truth is that many are naturally inclined to do so. For those that do not have this inclination, let them go on their own path in freedom.

So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.

The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, ""Dude. that's pretty dangerous. You thought what happened to the other pigs was bad? You're dealing with some dangerous materials there."" The pig insisted it was safe, though the wolf had his doubts. The wolf had a college degree and liked to think of himself as pretty smart. 
The wolf was like, ""I'm not sure I want to risk my life on this.
 I'll go track down the 91st little pig"". The pig felt bad, but he just let the wolf go. 
The wolf found the 91st little pig's house, which was made out of depleted uranium.
 He was hesitant because it was still uranium. He wanted to be sure it was safe though. He went and got a tool that could check for radiation. The 91st pig watched him from inside of his house. Curious, the pig came outside to ask what was happening.

""Are you a home inspector?"" asked the pig. The wolf said he was here to blow his house down but wanted to check the safety first. This pig was not too bright so he went into his house, coming back out with an inspection sheet. He showed it to the wolf. ""This inspection shows it is perfectly safe."" said the pig. 
""Okay, I'll go get my dynamite,"" said the wolf.
 
""I thought you were going to blow it down?"" asked the pig.
""This sheet says the house is quite well built so I'll need the big guns."" said the wolf.

The not very bright 91st pig waited for him to return. He decided to stand outside as he watched the wolf blow up his house. After, he and the wolf just looked at each other in confusion.

""Now what?"" asked the pig. 
""I'm not sure, we've never really gotten this far with a well built house before."" said the wolf.

""Well, I guess I'm going to go move in with the 90th pig. Want to come?"" asked the pig.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is art. Yes I know most people would disagree with me here, but hear me out. Art is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you express yourself, how to be yourself. Art also teaches a student creativity. Creativity is a very important thing to learn, because it helps you think outside the box. 

Art comes in so many forms, that if we completely removed it from our lives, we would really miss it and then realize how important it is. Inventors are inventive in a way because art gives their imaginations strength to come up with ideas for products and services. Art plays a major role in our lives on an everyday basis, and most of us do not even realize it. 

Some of the forms of art are painting, drawing, sculpting, and music just name a few. Without art, there would be no entertaining movies or TV shows. There would be no beautiful architecture, like the Eiffel Tower. There would be no Mona Lisa. There would be no music, or comedy, or even mimes that entertain us on the street for a dollar or two.

Without art, this world would be a very dull, plain, and boring place. That is why I believe that art is the most important subject for students to learn while in school. It can also make you rich sometimes.","{'Total number of sentences': 21, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 11, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (18, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 18: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 21'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( 'user', 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 12 nodes and 12 edges,0,7," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions the action 'user', the action 'empty-call', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to a book is just as good as reading it without a doubt. I think there are many advantages to listening to an audio book in my personal opinion. Sometimes the reader's voice even ties into the book, and makes the book feel even more real. For example, if you listen to a harry potter book using audible, the voice matches that of the characters in harry potter. Its that british sounding voice. In addition to this, you are able to listen to the book in many more situations and places than you would be able to physically read a book. I can lay down in bed without having to sit up and listen to a book, or listen to a book while driving, or while cleaning up in the house, or even while taking the dogs for a walk. This makes it much easier to indulge yourself into a good book. I personally do not feel that there are any advantages to reading a book physically over listening. I think it is simply preference. Reading is more quiet and can allow some people the ability to immerse themselves a little more. However, i dont really find reading to have any advantages like audiobooks do, especially for efficiency. I am a huge fan of being efficient, and being able to listen while still working or doing other activities is the seller for me. You may even save money using an audiobook, as normally these are subscriptions and you can get titles for cheaper. I pay a monthly fee for a certain number of credits for my subscription, and normally one credit is the equivalent of one book. The monthly fee is only 15 dollars a month, so do the math on that. If your heavy into books, this is well worth it, not only for the books but for the service. I personally am a huge fan of audible, i love the ability to be able to download and listen to my books at my own steps. Audible is an app that you can download where there are many audiobooks available at your disposal. Audible is associated with amazon, and i have an amazon prime so this was a no brainer for me. I believe you even get free credits simply because you are a prime member as well. Dont know the exact number on this however. These are all reasons why i feel using audiobooks have so many advantages. Just grab a pair of headphones and listen on the go. Search the library for whatever books you may be interested in, and even find books out that you may be interested in. There is a rating system just like amazon has on their main site, and this allows you to know what other people think of the book. So in conclusion, I feel listening to a book is just as good as reading one.","{'Total number of sentences': 33, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 24, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 2}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 2, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 0}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (25, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (26, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (31, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (32, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (33, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user', 'empty-call'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 25: ['user'], 26: ['user'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 30: ['user'], 31: ['user'], 32: ['user'], 33: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 33'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3' ), 'prompt' ) ), 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) )",DiGraph with 11 nodes and 11 edges,22,22," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call'"
104,e154ac86120c4521b5355141a96706e8,"Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?

Some sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?

---

In my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.

So, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

Of course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.

Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is a rational, common-sense, empirical one, aiming to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level. This will balance the desire for personal liberty, with the need to protect the safety of the participants.","{'Total number of sentences': 25, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 5, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 2, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 17}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 29, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 21, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 8, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 21}","[(5, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (6, array(['gpt3-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user', 'empty-call', 'user'],

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, to fully absorb a book you need to read it.  You can't get the full effect of a book by listening to it.  There are some positives to listening to a book, such as being able to listen to a book while doing other things, being able to listen in places where you could not read, such as being in the car, or being able to listen to a book when you are too tired to read.  However, all of these things point to the reason it is better to read a book.  To get the most from a book, it needs your fully attention, the things that make listening to it attractive also mean you are not fully engaged, you are doing other things that need some of your attention.   I believe if you listen to it, some of the content passes you by, you miss out on some of the finer details and you miss the nuances that make a book great.  Listening is useful, and a pleasant past time, but it is not the same as reading.  So while you can enjoy an audio book, you will not get the same experience as you would from reading the book.  That experience allows you to gain more from the written text and understand what the author is conveying.  So, in conclusion, I believe it is better to read a book than listen to it.","{'Total number of sentences': 17, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 4, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 5}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 17, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 8, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 9, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 7}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'],

The movie is a documentary of your next life, and you watch it as it unfolds.


Unfortunately, the movie is rather boring, and the other people around you seem to notice as well.  A couple of them are even texting each other on their smartphones.
You are bored out of your mind, and you can't wait for the movie to be over.
  

You decide to make conversation with the person sitting next to you.  He looks just like you, but is more fashionably dressed.
""So, what do you think of the movie?"" you ask him.
  

""I've been here for a few movies already.  This is actually one of the better ones""

""Are they all boring?"" you ask.

""Mostly, but this one is a masterpiece compared to another one that I've seen""
""What was that one about?"" you ask.


""Ugh, you don't even want to know"" he replies.

""No, come on.  Tell me!"" you plead.

Well, it was about a guy who was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and he lived a very boring life
""

""Hmm, I can almost sympathize with him"" you say.  ""Lots of people are born in small towns.  It isn't their fault""
""Yeah, but it gets worse.
  You wouldn't believe some of the choices this guy made, or more correctly, the choices he didn't make.""

""So he never made it out of his small town, then, did he?"" you ask.

No, he never did""  your dapper counterpart replies, ""and it would have been so easy for him""


""Well, I lived in a small town"" you retort, ""it's not always easy to get away when there are no opportunities"".
""Yeah, but this guy was a total loser.
  And besides, we all have the same opportunity.  Didn't you get the message from us in childhood about following the white rabbit?  This guy in the movie saw that rabbit in the park, on the sidewalk, in his front yard, and he never followed it.  He just shook his head and went back to his desk.""

""You mean 'Alice in Wonderland'?"" you ask the well-dressed man

""Yeah, we all got something like that in our lives.  Luckily, most of us figured out what it meant, and that's why we're here in the theater voluntarily.""

""I see"" you say to the man

""By the way"" he asks you, ""what was the code phrase that they gave you when you first arrived?  You know, when they told you that you did everything right during your first life""

You struggle to think of what to say, but as you try to speak, the movie ends with the character falling over at his desk.  

""Well that was almost as bad as the movie that played right before you arrived"" the well-dressed man snorts.  ""Ah well, when you live in heaven, sometimes it can be fun to visit the other side.""  He then mutters some obscure code and disappears.

You try to get up, but realize that your muscles won't allow it.  

Another movie starts playing.  It's another version of you on screen, at a desk just like yours.  You think you see a rabbit on his lawn, outside of his window, but he doesn't see it.

107,e66a5afb693c47e8b30faeb12e10a7cf,"How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?

Have you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?

How do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?

---

In my opinion, technology both improves and worsens dating experiences depending on how you use it. There are pros and cons to everything and dating apps and websites are no different. Many people have had success with dating apps. People meet on the app and fast forward 5-10 years and they're married. 

Technology has helped ease the stress and anxiety that goes into dating. I don't care who you are, there is always nerves when you're meeting someone for the first time that you're attracted to. Luckily, technology allows us to break the ice and speak to those people before meeting them in person. FaceTime allows us to confirm that the person we're talking to on the other side is real and isn't a Catfish as well.

Speaking of Catfish, that is definitely a negative aspect of dating technology. There even was a television show made about it. Catfishing is simply using someone else's profile picture on a dating app to trick them into thinking they're talking to someone that they're not actually talking to. Catfishing has been used for revenge as well as in scenarios where the catfishers just have very low self esteem.

Another positive aspect of technology that probably doesn't get talked about enough is the ability to catch someone cheating with evidence. This evidence can be via photograph, video or text messages. Now you might be thinking this is a negative aspect but to me, it's a positive.

If you were being cheated on, would you want to know or would you rather never know and your partner is screwing you over on a daily basis and being with someone else. Sure the pain in the beginning hurts really bad but that pain is only temporary. That pain isn't as bad as being married to someone that is a cheater and doesn't truly love you.

So in general, dating apps and websites and other technology have both a positive and negative affect on relationships. Since I am an optimist, I would say that the good outweighs the bad.

In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don't keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?

---

In my opinion, this is a tough topic to take a stand on. I had written in favor of keeping up on the news in the past, but would like to change my stance and see where that leads. I don't think it is necessarily prudent for everyone to keep up with current events. The issue we have today is that people aren't always getting their news from reliable sources. If you don't know the difference between news, entertainment, and junk, it can be a big problem to know what is true and not. With the prevalence of social media and the actual lies that are stated as factual news on such sites, people getting and then believing misinformation can lead to real issues. In my opinion is it worse to believe news that is incorrect than to not have any information at all. False beliefs can lead to one person telling tens and hundreds of people and so one.  A lie repeated 100 times is far more believable than the truth told only once. With that thought, rumors can become reality and people don't really end up knowing the news anyhow.
So how do we keep up with current events, but avoid the junk?
 I think this is almost impossible in today's world. As long as social media sites allow people to post anything they want, some of the items declared as news will continue to be nothing more than garbage. I don't think people are bad citizens if they don't keep up with the news. I think we should try to be informed of world events, but that isn't always possible in our hurried lives. There is still the old tried and true way of getting news from friends and relatives. This can lead to also getting their version of news, tainted with their opinions, but it is still a way to pass on information. For some people, who cannot afford the luxuries in life of time to sit and watch the news, or the education level to sort out fact from fiction, passing on of events from family is all the have. This doesn't make these people any less of a good citizen or responsible person. We all try to do what we can. Simply stated, sometimes trying is the best we can do.

I would love to see everyone up to date on world and national events. I understand, however, that this simply isn't a reality for all people. It is more important, to me, that the people who produce the news, produce honest telecasts. From these viewings and readings, those that partake of what is stated can responsibly pass on what they have learned to others.","{'Total number of sentences': 30, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 6, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 20, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 0, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 4}","[(6, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (7, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (8, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (11, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (14, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (15, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (16, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (22, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (26, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (27, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (28, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (29, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (30, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{6: ['prompt', 'user'], 7: ['user'], 8: ['user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 11: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['user'], 14: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 15: ['user'], 16: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['user'], 22: ['user'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 26: ['user', 'empty-call'], 27: ['user'], 28: ['user'], 29: ['user'], 30: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 6'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 30'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( 'prompt', 'gpt3-call' ) ), *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) )",DiGraph with 11 nodes and 12 edges,1,18," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between the action 'prompt', the action 'gpt3-call' and a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, listening to an audiobook is like looking at a painting without ever seeing it in person. You are technically experiencing it but you are missing out on the fine details that make it special. It's an experience, not just a story. his is not to say that audiobooks are inferior.
 They just are an alternate experience. They just lack the full experience that you otherwise could be having with a book. 
Have you ever listened to an audiobook?
 The process alone is different. You're not using your eyes. You're listening and hearing someone else read the story. You're not hearing it in your head. Instead, you're hearing someone else and their voice emphasizing key parts of the story. It just makes it different. The experience is still valid for sure. It's just different. 

I enjoy listening when I do not have free time to focus specifically to a book. This way I can listen to the story when doing something else. I feel like that's how most people listen, so they can multitask while listening. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that audiobooks are bad, I'm just giving insight as to how I look at them
. They are an alternate choice, not the primary choice for reading. It's good to keep in the back of your mind that there is more than one way to read. It's like having one in your holster just in case. Reading is overlooked so any form of it is better than not doing it at all. 
I would recommend listening to audiobooks if you're in a car or doing something else that requires your attention outside of just the book
. Maybe listen to one while taking a bath. If you have the time however, sit down and hold a book. Flip through the pages and enjoy the unique experience that is brings. You'll treasure that story even more because of that experience.

It's hot.  Sweat trickles all over me including into my eyes.  Still, I remain immobile.  Jeez, it seems like hours I've been standing here.  Why doesn't this bee take off and go find some sweet flower to sip from?  I'm not a flower, I'm a human being!

I can see the bee out of the corner of my eye.  It's sitting there just as pretty as you please as if it has a right to be there.  Fly away, fly away I think to myself, that's why you have wings!  I'm very hot and very tired and I want to go inside.  I want to be anywhere else but here with this dratted bee.

The alien is a bit of a showman, and has decided to put on a show for his fellow aliens, with Matt Damon as the
 co-star and antagonist of sorts. What the alien really wants, more than anything the people of Earth can trade for Matt's well being, is to be the star of a great show. 
The show is a parody of the movie ""The Producers"", with the alien as Max Bialystock and Matt Damon as Leo Bloom
, only done with a more intergalactic audience in mind. He is trying his best to put on a comedic performance about the business of show business, which is something that all beings have in common. Every species loves a good show. 

The alien goes through the steps of contacting the people of Earth, demanding to speak to their leader because that's what aliens in stories do. The shocked people of Earth send forth a proposal, which is actually pretty good but the alien isn't really interested in the trade value of Matt, he's in it for the credit. He's a showman, and he knows that he's going to get a lot of it.

When the show is finally finished, he lets Matt go. Matt, realizing that he has now expanded his resume to include an Intergalactic Entertainment Group credit, tells everyone that he was in on the show, the whole time. He goes so far as to imply that he helped to write the script, though he knows that there was not script for this production. 
Matt Damon, and the alien, are both happy with the outcome.

In your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?

---

In my opinion, one of the most important things that students should learn in schools is actually learning how to identify good sources of information.   While attempting to learn something new, you need to identify what is a good source of information versus a bad source of information.  For example, there are certain websites on the internet that are known for giving reliable information.  There are other websites that are not known for giving reliable information.   These sources may be good to read, but they are not reliable sources for getting factual information on a certain topic.   

This is something that can be taught in school.  For example, let's say a student is writing a paper on an ethical dilemma and wants to go get something from the internet as a source of information.   Certain teachers will only accept references from websites that are known to provide good information.   There are so many issues today in the real world where they have started the learning process on the wrong foot because they are using information from unreliable websites.

This is something that I learned during my years at school.  I would say that this is one of the more valuable lessons.  You only have a certain amount of time at school so you can't learn everything that you need to perform outside of school.  That is why you need to learn the proper way to approach learning.   I wish more adults could take a course in how to identify good sources.   We waste a lot of time on issues that could be eliminated once people realize they are using bad sources of information.

When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. That old power is the Mana Tree, a living record of all the magic ever performed. For centuries it slumbered, withered, seemingly dead. But now , with Mana returning to the world, it has begun to bloom once more.  As it grows, its power begins to return to the world, along with the knowledge of how to use that power. 
ASeizingfupon the desperate hope the tree brings, two actions hoorm both dedicated to studying The Mana Tree and harnessing its power.
  The first, the Keepers of The Mana Tree, seek to preserve and grow the tree. The second, the Harvesters, seek to cut into the tree, releasing the Mana that it holds in the hope that it will restore humanity to its former magical state.  he fate of the world rests in the hands of those who would harvest it... and the hands of those who would protect it.


Meanwhile, the Mana Tree is changing the world.   The power of Mana is slowly spreading, aided by the growth of the tree, awakening magic in those with a strong affinity for it. As this occurs, some humans gain the magic that they need to fight against the aliens.  nfortunately, this new magical power is unstable., and though it wins some victories against the conquerors of Earth, it also deserts its users, or even kills them. For now, it's not enough to turn the tide of battle. 

Meanwhile, the Havesters are continuing to cut pieces from the tree, despite warnings from The Keepers. Those who anoint themselves with the sap gleaned from the cuttings, and wield the cut wood, gain incredible power, enough to occasionally defeat the invaders. But this is only temporary, and slows the long term spread of mana. Despite this, the Havesters continue to cut, believing that the survival of humanity requires that they do so. They overwhelm the opposition of The Keepers, and are able to gain enough temporary power to drive the invaders away.

So, the battle is won, but the war is lost. The cutting has been too much for the tree to survive, and with its death, the mana that, unknown to all, keeps the Earth alive, dies with it. The Harvesters are left with their power to rule over a dying and soon-to-be-lifeless world.","{'Total number of sentences': 25, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 3, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 11, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 1, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 10}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 15, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 13, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 2, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 4, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 9}","[(3, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (4, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (5, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (6, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (7, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (9, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (20, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (21, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (22, array(['user', 'empty-call'], dtype='<U10')), (23, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (24, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (25, array(['gpt3-call'], dtype='<U9'))]","{3: ['prompt', 'user'], 4: ['user'], 5: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 6: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 7: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 9: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['gpt3-call', 'gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 20: ['user'], 21: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 22: ['user', 'empty-call'], 23: ['user'], 24: ['user'], 25: ['gpt3-call']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 3'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 25'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'gpt3-call'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( *( 'gpt3-call', tau ), X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), X( tau, *( ->( 'user', X( tau, 'empty-call' ) ), tau ) ) )",DiGraph with 16 nodes and 20 edges,5,20," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by a loop between the actions the action 'gpt3-call', a silent action and an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt', meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence and an exclusive choice between a silent action, a loop between the actions  followed by the action 'user', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'empty-call' and a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations"" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

The side effects that happen are shocking, and almost unbelievable. They include things like when you turn 85 , you fall into a coma, and when you wake up, you're a baby. While yes, you could consider this immortality, it's not exactly what science had in mind. They developed the drug from the immortal jelly fish called Turritopsis Nutricula. 

Science had to come up with a solution, because eventually there would be nothing except children left to take care of the worlds problems, and that would be a disaster. So after long years of searching, and developing, and many more years of testing they finally had a solution. It was derived from the leaves of the sacred lotus plant, and it was called the Lotus Solution. No one knew why it worked. It just did. 

They had to figure a way to dispense the drug, because they knew not everyone wanted to take it, so they came up with a plan. That plan was to put it in the worlds water supply. Well, after around a year, the drug was in the water supply. Then as people drank the water, they stopped going into a coma at 85, and might live for another 5-10 years before they would die. Even though it was a failed science experiment, there was a lot scientists learned like not to play with nature.

118,fdd85d76a9eb42d994e75ce952202309,"Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?

Do you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?

---

In my opinion, audiobooks are the way to go. I love to read, but I don't always have the time to sit down and read a book. But, with an audiobook, I can listen to the latest novel while I do mundane tasks that I have to do, such as laundry or dishes. I almost look forward to doing tasks that would otherwise be lame without an audiobook. Another reason I prefer audiobooks is that I don't have to tire out my eyes to experience them. At the end of a hard day of thinking and staring at screens, the last thing I want to do to my eyes is stare at little letters on a page. For this alone,  think audiobooks are just as good as reading.
 Another advantage of audiobooks is one I don't experience personally but you have to admit it's fantastic that the vision impaired can experience books through audiobooks. I understand braille books aren't cheap and it just seems like it would be more relaxing and enjoyable for anyone to listen to a book. Another reason audiobooks are really great is that you can take it with you, unlike a shelf full of books. You can carry a small device to a mountaintop and listen to 10 different books if you want. I can't do that with books. It would be silly to carry a shelf of books. It may be silly to read for a week on a mountain too, but hey, the option is there, thanks to audiobooks! All in all, there are far more advantages than disadvantages to audiobooks over traditional books and that is why I prefer them.","{'Total number of sentences': 21, 'Number of sentences of initial prompt': 7, 'Number of sentences completely authored by the user': 10, 'Number of sentences completely authored by GPT-3': 0, 'Number of sentences authored by GPT-3 and user': 4}","{'Total number of GPT-3 calls made': 7, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used': 4, 'Number of times user rejected GPT-3 suggestion': 3, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is modified': 1, 'Number of times GPT-3 suggestion is used as is': 3}","[(7, array(['prompt', 'user'], dtype='<U6')), (8, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (9, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (10, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (11, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (12, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (13, array(['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], dtype='<U11')), (14, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (15, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (16, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (17, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (18, array(['gpt3-call', 'user'], dtype='<U9')), (19, array(['user'], dtype='<U4')), (20, array(['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], dtype='<U10')), (21, array(['user'], dtype='<U4'))]","{7: ['prompt', 'user'], 8: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 9: ['user'], 10: ['user'], 11: ['user', 'empty-call', 'empty-call', 'user'], 12: ['user'], 13: ['gpt3-call', 'modify-gpt3', 'user'], 14: ['user'], 15: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 16: ['user'], 17: ['user'], 18: ['gpt3-call', 'user'], 19: ['user'], 20: ['user', 'empty-call', 'user'], 21: ['user']}","[{'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 7'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'prompt'}, '..', {'concept:name': 'user'}]}, '....', {'attributes': {'concept:name': 'Sentence 21'}, 'events': [{'concept:name': 'user'}]}]","->( X( tau, X( ->( 'gpt3-call', X( tau, 'modify-gpt3' ) ), 'prompt' ) ), *( 'user', *( 'empty-call', tau ) ) )",DiGraph with 13 nodes and 14 edges,14,3," followed by an exclusive choice between a silent action, an exclusive choice between  followed by the action 'gpt3-call', an exclusive choice between a silent action, the action 'modify-gpt3' and the action 'prompt' and a loop between the actions the action 'user', a loop between the actions the action 'empty-call', a silent action, meaning that these actions can be repeated multiple times in sequence"
119,ffa97e9f02214fdaad83cabea410c1d9,"What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?

What stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?

---

In my opinion, the most offensive stereotypical characters are the ones that are used to make a point. A good example is horror movies. They like to amplify characters traits because there isn't enough time for complex character development. Because of that you end up with a movie filled with stereotypes. You have the jock, the slutty one, the brain, racial stereotype and sometimes the flamboyant gay person who makes jokes. They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. 

It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that. 

Media has evolved when it comes to portraying stereotypes. Remakes are being done where once weak female characters are now tougher. Even the infamous Psycho death scene was changed for the show Bates Motel. The iconic female victim switched to a male victim in the shower. 

I personally don't have a problem with stereotypes. Sometimes I may cringe when I see them but that's part of it. Characters are getting written with more depth these days so it's becoming less of an issue.
